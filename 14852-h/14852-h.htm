<h3>HIS OWN PEOPLE</h3>
<p>"You never met Selwyn, did you?"</p>
<p>"No, sir."</p>
<p>"Never heard anything definite about his trouble?" insisted
Gerard.</p>
<p>"Oh, yes, sir!" replied young Erroll, "I've heard a good deal
about it. Everybody has, you know."</p>
<p>"Well, I <i>don't</i> know," retorted Austin Gerard irritably,
"what 'everybody' has heard, but I suppose it's the usual garbled
version made up of distorted fact and malicious gossip. That's why
I sent for you. Sit down."</p>
<p>Gerald Erroll seated himself on the edge of the big, polished
table in Austin's private office, one leg swinging, an unlighted
cigarette between his lips.</p>
<p>Austin Gerard, his late guardian, big, florid, with that
peculiar blue eye which seems to characterise hasty temper, stood
by the window, tossing up and catching the glittering gold
piece&mdash;souvenir of the directors' meeting which he had just
left.</p>
<p>"What has happened," he said, "is this. Captain Selwyn is back
in town&mdash;sent up his card to me, but they told him I was
attending a directors' meeting. When the meeting was over I found
his card and a message scribbled, saying he'd recently landed and
was going uptown to call on Nina. She'll keep him there, of course,
until I get home, so I shall see him this evening. Now, before you
meet him, I want you to plainly understand the truth about this
unfortunate affair; and that's why I telephoned your gimlet-eyed
friend Neergard just now to let you come around here for half an
hour."</p>
<p>The boy nodded and, drawing a gold matchbox from his waistcoat
pocket, lighted his cigarette.</p>
<p>"Why the devil don't you smoke cigars?" growled Austin, more to
himself than to Gerald; then, pocketing the gold piece, seated
himself heavily in his big leather desk-chair.</p>
<p>"In the first place," he said, "Captain Selwyn is my
brother-in-law&mdash;which wouldn't make an atom of difference to
me in my judgment of what has happened if he had been at fault. But
the facts of the case are these." He held up an impressive
forefinger and laid it flat across the large, ruddy palm of the
other hand. "First of all, he married a cat! C-a-t, cat. Is that
clear, Gerald?"</p>
<p>"Yes, sir."</p>
<p>"Good! What sort of a dance she led him out there in Manila,
I've heard. Never mind that, now. What I want you to know is how he
behaved&mdash;with what quiet dignity, steady patience, and sweet
temper under constant provocation and mortification, he conducted
himself. Then that fellow Ruthven turned up&mdash;and&mdash;Selwyn
is above that sort of suspicion. Besides, his scouts took the field
within a week."</p>
<p>He dropped a heavy, highly coloured fist on his desk with a
bang.</p>
<p>"After that hike, Selwyn came back, to find that Alixe had
sailed with Jack Ruthven. And what did he do; take legal measures
to free himself, as you or I or anybody with an ounce of temper in
'em would have done? No; he didn't. That infernal Selwyn conscience
began to get busy, making him believe that if a woman kicks over
the traces it must be because of some occult shortcoming on his
part. In some way or other that man persuaded himself of his
responsibility for her misbehaviour. He knew what it meant if he
didn't ask the law to aid him to get rid of her; he knew perfectly
well that his silence meant acknowledgment of culpability; that he
couldn't remain in the service under such suspicion.</p>
<p>"And now, Gerald," continued Austin, striking his broad palm
with extended forefinger and leaning heavily forward, "I'll tell
you what sort of a man Philip Selwyn is. He permitted Alixe to sue
him for absolute divorce&mdash;and, to give her every chance to
marry Ruthven, he refused to defend the suit. That sort of chivalry
is very picturesque, no doubt, but it cost him his career&mdash;set
him adrift at thirty-five, a man branded as having been divorced
from his wife for cause, with no profession left him, no business,
not much money&mdash;a man in the prime of life and hope and
ambition, clean in thought and deed; an upright, just, generous,
sensitive man, whose whole career has been blasted because he was
too merciful, too generous to throw the blame where it belonged.
And it belongs on the shoulders of that Mrs. Jack
Ruthven&mdash;Alixe Ruthven&mdash;whose name you may see in the
columns of any paper that truckles to the sort of society she
figures in."</p>
<p>Austin stood up, thrust his big hands into his pockets, paced
the room for a few moments, and halted before Gerald.</p>
<p>"If any woman ever played me a dirty trick," he said, "I'd see
that the public made no mistake in placing the blame. I'm that
sort"&mdash;he shrugged&mdash;"Phil Selwyn isn't; that's the
difference&mdash;and it may be in his favour from an ethical and
sentimental point of view. All right; let it go at that. But all I
meant you to understand is that he is every inch a man; and when
you have the honour to meet him, keep that fact in the back of your
head, among the few brains with which Providence has equipped
you."</p>
<p>"Thanks!" said Gerald, colouring up. He cast his cigarette into
the empty fireplace, slid off the edge of the table, and picked up
his hat. Austin eyed him without particular approval.</p>
<p>"You buy too many clothes," he observed. "That's a new suit,
isn't it?"</p>
<p>"Certainly," said Gerald; "I needed it."</p>
<p>"Oh! if you can afford it, all right. . . . How's the nimble Mr.
Neergard?"</p>
<p>"Neergard is flourishing. We put through that Rose Valley deal.
I tell you what, Austin, I wish you could see your way clear to
finance one or two&mdash;"</p>
<p>Austin's frown cut him short.</p>
<p>"Oh, all right! You know your own business, of course," said the
boy, a little resentfully. "Only as Fane, Harmon &amp; Co. have
thought it worth while&mdash;"</p>
<p>"I don't care what Fane, Harmon think," growled Austin, touching
a button over his desk. His stenographer entered; he nodded a curt
dismissal to Gerald, adding, as the boy reached the door:</p>
<p>"Your sister expects you to be on hand to-night&mdash;and so do
we."</p>
<p>Gerald halted.</p>
<p>"I'd clean forgotten," he began; "I made another&mdash;a rather
important engagement&mdash;"</p>
<p>But Austin was not listening; in fact, he had already begun to
dictate to his demure stenographer, and Gerald stood a moment,
hesitating, then turned on his heel and went away down the
resounding marble corridor.</p>
<p>"They never let me alone," he muttered; "they're always at
me&mdash;following me up as though I were a schoolboy. . . .
Austin's the worst&mdash;never satisfied. . . . What do I care for
all these functions&mdash;sitting around with the younger set and
keeping the cradle of conversation rocking? I won't go to that
infernal baby-show!"</p>
<p>He entered the elevator and shot down to the great rotunda,
still scowling over his grievance. For he had made arrangements to
join a card-party at Julius Neergard's rooms that night, and he had
no intention of foregoing that pleasure just because his sister's
first grown-up dinner-party was fixed for the same date.</p>
<p>As for this man Selwyn, whom he had never met, he saw no reason
why he should drop business and scuttle uptown in order to welcome
him. No doubt he was a good fellow; no doubt he had behaved very
decently in a matter which, until a few moments before, he had
heard little about. He meant to be civil; he'd look up Selwyn when
he had a chance, and ask him to dine at the club. But this
afternoon he couldn't do it; and, as for the evening, he had made
his arrangements, and he had no intention of disturbing them on
Austin's account.</p>
<p>When he reached his office he picked up the telephone and called
up Gerard's house; but neither his sister nor anybody else was
there except the children and servants, and Captain Selwyn had not
yet called. So he left no message, merely saying that he'd call up
again. Which he forgot to do.</p>
<hr style='width: 45%;' />
<p>Meanwhile Captain Selwyn was sauntering along Fifth Avenue under
the leafless trees, scanning the houses of the rich and great
across the way; and these new houses of the rich and great stared
back at him out of a thousand casements as polished and
expressionless as the monocles of the mighty.</p>
<p>And, strolling at leisure in the pleasant winter weather, he
came presently to a street, stretching eastward in all the cold
impressiveness of very new limestone and plate-glass.</p>
<p>Could this be the street where his sister now lived?</p>
<p>As usual when perplexed he slowly raised his hand to his
moustache; and his pleasant gray eyes, still slightly blood-shot
from the glare of the tropics, narrowed as he inspected this
unfamiliar house.</p>
<p>The house was a big elaborate limestone affair, evidently new.
Winter sunshine sparkled on lace-hung casement, on glass marquise,
and the burnished bronze foliations of grille and door.</p>
<p>It was flood-tide along Fifth Avenue; motor, brougham, and
victoria swept by on the glittering current; pretty women glanced
out from limousine and tonneau; young men of his own type,
silk-hatted, frock-coated, the crooks of their walking sticks
tucked up under their left arms, passed on the Park side.</p>
<p>But the nods of recognition, lifted hats, the mellow warnings of
motor horns, clattering hoofs, the sun flashing on carriage wheels
and polished panels, on liveries, harness, on the satin coats of
horses&mdash;a gem like a spark of fire smothered by the sables at
a woman's throat, and the bright indifference of her
beauty&mdash;all this had long since lost any meaning for him. For
him the pageant passed as the west wind passes in Samar over the
glimmering valley grasses; and he saw it through sun-dazzled
eyes&mdash;all this, and the leafless trees beyond against the sky,
and the trees mirrored in a little wintry lake as brown as the
brown of the eyes which were closed to him now forever.</p>
<p>As he stood there, again he seemed to hear the whistle signal,
clear, distant, rippling across the wind-blown grasses where the
brown constabulary lay firing in the sunshine; but the rifle shots
were the crack of whips, and it was only a fat policeman of the
traffic squad whistling to clear the swarming jungle trails of the
great metropolis.</p>
<p>Again Selwyn turned to the house, hesitating, unreconciled.
Every sun-lit window stared back at him.</p>
<p>He had not been prepared for so much limestone and marquise
magnificence where there was more renaissance than architecture and
more bay-window than both; but the number was the number of his
sister's house; and, as the street and the avenue corroborated the
numbered information, he mounted the doorstep, rang, and leisurely
examined four stiff box-trees flanking the ornate
portal&mdash;meagre vegetation compared to what he had been
accustomed to for so many years.</p>
<p>Nobody came; once or twice he fancied he heard sounds proceeding
from inside the house. He rang again and fumbled for his card case.
Somebody was coming.</p>
<p>The moment that the door opened he was aware of a distant and
curious uproar&mdash;far away echoes of cheering, and the faint
barking of dogs. These seemed to cease as the man in waiting
admitted him; but before he could make an inquiry or produce a
card, bedlam itself apparently broke loose somewhere in the
immediate upper landing&mdash;noise in its crudest elemental
definition&mdash;through which the mortified man at the door strove
to make himself heard: "Beg pardon, sir, it's the children broke
loose an' runnin' wild-like&mdash;"</p>
<p>"The <i>what</i>?"</p>
<p>"Only the children, sir&mdash;fox-huntin' the cat,
sir&mdash;"</p>
<p>His voice was lost in the yelling dissonance descending
crescendo from floor to floor. Then an avalanche of children and
dogs poured down the hall-stairs in pursuit of a rumpled and bored
cat, tumbling with yelps and cheers and thuds among the thick rugs
on the floor.</p>
<p>Here the cat turned and soundly cuffed a pair of fat beagle
puppies, who shrieked and fled, burrowing for safety into the
yelling heap of children and dogs on the floor. Above this heap
legs, arms, and the tails of dogs waved wildly for a moment, then a
small boy, blond hair in disorder, staggered to his knees, and,
setting hollowed hand to cheek, shouted: "Hi! for'rard! Harkaway
for'rard! Take him, Rags! Now, Tatters! After him, Owney! Get on,
there, Schnitzel! Worry him, Stinger! Tally-ho-o!"</p>
<p>At which encouraging invitation the two fat beagle pups, a
waddling dachshund, a cocker, and an Irish terrier flew at Selwyn's
nicely creased trousers; and the small boy, rising to his feet,
became aware of that astonished gentleman for the first time.</p>
<p>"Steady, there!" exclaimed Selwyn, bringing his walking stick to
a brisk bayonet defence; "steady, men! Prepare to receive
infantry&mdash;and doggery, too!" he added, backing away. "No
quarter! Remember the Alamo!"</p>
<p>The man at the door had been too horrified to speak, but he
found his voice now.</p>
<p>"Oh, you hush up, Dawson!" said the boy; and to Selwyn he added
tentatively, "Hello!"</p>
<p>"Hello yourself," replied Selwyn, keeping off the circling pups
with the point of his stick. "What is this, anyway&mdash;a
Walpurgis hunt?&mdash;or Eliza and the bloodhounds?"</p>
<p>Several children, disentangling themselves from the heap, rose
to confront the visitor; the shocked man, Dawson, attempted to
speak again, but Selwyn's raised hand quieted him.</p>
<p>The small boy with the blond hair stepped forward and dragged
several dogs from the vicinity of Selwyn's shins.</p>
<p>"This is the Shallowbrook hunt," he explained; "I am Master of
Hounds; my sister Drina, there, is one of the whips. Part of the
game is to all fall down together and pretend we've come croppers.
You see, don't you?"</p>
<p>"I see," nodded Selwyn; "it's a pretty stiff hunting country,
isn't it?"</p>
<p>"Yes, it is. There's wire, you know," volunteered the girl,
Drina, rubbing the bruises on her plump shins.</p>
<p>"Exactly," agreed Selwyn; "bad thing, wire. Your whips should
warn you."</p>
<p>The big black cat, horribly bored by the proceedings, had
settled down on a hall seat, keeping one disdainful yellow eye on
the dogs.</p>
<p>"All the same, we had a pretty good run," said Drina, taking the
cat into her arms and seating herself on the cushions; "didn't we,
Kit-Ki?" And, turning to Selwyn, "Kit-Ki makes a pretty good
fox&mdash;only she isn't enough afraid of us to run away very fast.
Won't you sit down? Our mother is not at home, but we are."</p>
<p>"Would you really like to have me stay?" asked Selwyn.</p>
<p>"Well," admitted Drina frankly, "of course we can't tell yet how
interesting you are because we don't know you. We are trying to be
polite&mdash;" and, in a fierce whisper, turning on the smaller of
the boys&mdash;"Winthrop! take your finger out of your mouth and
stop staring at guests! Billy, you make him behave himself."</p>
<p>The blond-haired M.F.H. reached for his younger brother; the
infant culprit avoided him and sullenly withdrew the sucked finger
but not his fascinated gaze.</p>
<p>"I want to know who he ith," he lisped in a loud aside.</p>
<p>"So do I," admitted a tiny maid in stickout skirts.</p>
<p>Drina dropped the cat, swept the curly hair from her eyes, and
stood up very straight in her kilts and bare knees.</p>
<p>"They don't really mean to be rude," she explained; "they're
only children." Then, detecting the glimmering smile in Selwyn's
eyes, "But perhaps you wouldn't mind telling us who you are because
we all would like to know, but we are not going to be ill-bred
enough to ask."</p>
<p>Their direct expectant gaze slightly embarrassed him; he laughed
a little, but there was no response from them.</p>
<p>"Well," he said, "as a matter of fact and record, I am a sort of
relative of yours&mdash;a species of avuncular relation."</p>
<p>"What is that?" asked Drina coldly.</p>
<p>"That," said Selwyn, "means that I'm more or less of an uncle to
you. Hope you don't mind. You don't have to entertain me, you
know."</p>
<p>"An uncle!" repeated Drina.</p>
<p>"Our uncle?" echoed Billy. "You are not our soldier uncle, are
you? You are not our Uncle Philip, are you?"</p>
<p>"It amounts to that," admitted Selwyn. "Is it all right?"</p>
<p>There was a dead silence, broken abruptly by Billy; "Where is
your sword, then?"</p>
<p>"At the hotel. Would you like to see it, Billy?"</p>
<p>The five children drew a step nearer, inspecting him with
merciless candour.</p>
<p>"Is it all right?" asked Selwyn again, smilingly uneasy under
the concentrated scrutiny. "How about it, Drina? Shall we shake
hands?"</p>
<p>Drina spoke at last: "Ye-es," she said slowly, "I think it is
all right to shake hands." She took a step forward, stretching out
her hand.</p>
<p>Selwyn stooped; she laid her right hand across his, hesitated,
looked up fearlessly, and then, raising herself on tiptoe, placed
both arms upon his shoulders, offering her lips.</p>
<p>One by one the other children came forward to greet this
promising new uncle whom the younger among them had never before
seen, and whom Drina, the oldest, had forgotten except as that
fabled warrior of legendary exploits whose name and fame had become
cherished classics of their nursery.</p>
<p>And now children and dogs clustered amicably around him; under
foot tails wagged, noses sniffed; playful puppy teeth tweaked at
his coat-skirts; and in front and at either hand eager flushed
little faces were upturned to his, shy hands sought his and nestled
confidently into the hollow of his palms or took firm proprietary
hold of sleeve and coat.</p>
<p>"I infer," observed Selwyn blandly, "that your father and mother
are not at home. Perhaps I'd better stop in later."</p>
<p>"But you are going to stay here, aren't you?" exclaimed Drina in
dismay. "Don't you expect to tell us stories? Don't you expect to
stay here and live with us and put on your uniform for us and show
us your swords and pistols? <i>Don't</i> you?"</p>
<p>"We have waited such a very long time for you to do this," added
Billy.</p>
<p>"If you'll come up to the nursery we'll have a drag-hunt for
you," pleaded Drina. "Everybody is out of the house and we can make
as much noise as we please! Will you?"</p>
<p>"Haven't you any governesses or nurses or something?" asked
Selwyn, finding himself already on the stairway, and still being
dragged upward.</p>
<p>"Our governess is away," said Billy triumphantly, "and our
nurses can do nothing with us."</p>
<p>"I don't doubt it," murmured Selwyn; "but where are they?"</p>
<p>"Somebody must have locked them in the schoolroom," observed
Billy carelessly. "Come on, Uncle Philip; we'll have a first-class
drag-hunt before we unlock the schoolroom and let them out."</p>
<p>"Anyway, they can brew tea there if they are lonely," added
Drina, ushering Selwyn into the big sunny nursery, where he stood,
irresolute, looking about him, aware that he was conniving at open
mutiny. From somewhere on the floor above persistent hammering and
muffled appeals satisfied him as to the location and indignation of
the schoolroom prisoners.</p>
<p>"You ought to let them out," he said. "You'll surely be
punished."</p>
<p>"We will let them out after we've made noise enough," said Billy
calmly. "We'll probably be punished anyway, so we may as well make
a noise."</p>
<p>"Yes," added Drina, "we are going to make all the noise we can
while we have the opportunity. Billy, is everything ready?"</p>
<p>And before Selwyn understood precisely what was happening, he
found himself the centre of a circle of madly racing children and
dogs. Round and round him they tore. Billy yelled for the hurdles
and Josephine knocked over some chairs and dragged them across the
course of the route; and over them leaped and scrambled children
and puppies, splitting the air with that same quality of din which
had greeted him upon his entrance to his sister's house.</p>
<p>When there was no more breath left in the children, and when the
dogs lay about, grinning and lolling, Drina approached him, bland
and dishevelled.</p>
<p>"That circus," she explained, "was for your entertainment. Now
will you please do something for ours?"</p>
<p>"Certainly," said Selwyn, looking about him vaguely; "shall
we&mdash;er&mdash;build blocks, or shall I read to
you&mdash;er&mdash;out of that big picture-book&mdash;"</p>
<p>"<i>Picture</i>-book!" repeated Billy with scorn; "that's good
enough for nurses to read. You're a soldier, you know. Soldiers
have real stories to tell."</p>
<p>"I see," he said meekly. "What am I to tell you about&mdash;our
missionaries in Sulu?"</p>
<p>"In the first place," began Drina, "you are to lie down flat on
the floor and creep about and show us how the Moros wriggle through
the grass to bolo our sentinels."</p>
<p>"Why, it's&mdash;it's this way," began Selwyn, leaning back in
his rocking-chair and comfortably crossing one knee over the other;
"for instance, suppose&mdash;"</p>
<p>"Oh, but you must <i>show</i> us!" interrupted Billy. "Get down
on the floor please, uncle."</p>
<p>"I can tell it better!" protested Selwyn; "I can show you just
the&mdash;"</p>
<p>"Please lie down and show us how they wriggle?" begged
Drina.</p>
<p>"I don't want to get down on the floor," he said feebly; "is it
necessary?"</p>
<p>But they had already discovered that he could be bullied, and
they had it their own way; and presently Selwyn lay prone upon the
nursery floor, impersonating a ladrone while pleasant shivers
chased themselves over Drina, whom he was stalking.</p>
<p>And it was while all were passionately intent upon the pleasing
and snake-like progress of their uncle that a young girl in furs,
ascending the stairs two at a time, peeped perfunctorily into the
nursery as she passed the hallway&mdash;and halted amazed.</p>
<p>Selwyn, sitting up rumpled and cross-legged on the floor, after
having boloed Drina to everybody's exquisite satisfaction, looked
around at the sudden rustle of skirts to catch a glimpse of a
vanishing figure&mdash;a glimmer of ruddy hair and the white curve
of a youthful face, half-buried in a muff.</p>
<p>Mortified, he got to his feet, glanced out into the hallway, and
began adjusting his attire.</p>
<p>"No, you don't!" he said mildly, "I decline to perform again. If
you want any more wriggling you must accomplish it yourselves.
Drina, has your governess&mdash;by any unfortunate
chance&mdash;er&mdash;red hair?"</p>
<p>"No," said the child; "and won't you <i>please</i> crawl across
the floor and bolo me&mdash;just <i>once</i> more?"</p>
<p>"Bolo me!" insisted Billy. "I haven't been mangled yet!"</p>
<p>"Let Billy assassinate somebody himself. And, by the way, Drina,
are there any maids or nurses or servants in this remarkable house
who occasionally wear copper-tinted hair and black fox furs?"</p>
<p>"No. Eileen does. Won't you please wriggle&mdash;"</p>
<p>"Who is Eileen?"</p>
<p>"Eileen? Why&mdash;don't you know who Eileen is?"</p>
<p>"No, I don't," began Captain Selwyn, when a delighted shout from
the children swung him toward the door again. His sister, Mrs.
Gerard, stood there in carriage gown and sables, radiant with
surprise.</p>
<p>"Phil! <i>You!</i> Exactly like you, Philip, to come strolling
in from the antipodes&mdash;dear fellow!" recovering from the
fraternal embrace and holding both lapels of his coat in her gloved
hands. "Six years!" she said again and again, tenderly reproachful;
"Alexandrine was a baby of six&mdash;Drina, child, do you remember
my brother&mdash;do you remember your Uncle Philip? She doesn't
remember; you can't expect her to recollect; she is only twelve,
Phil&mdash;"</p>
<p>"I remember <i>one</i> thing," observed Drina serenely.</p>
<p>Brother and sister turned toward her in pride and delight; and
the child went on: "My Aunt Alixe; I remember her. She was
<i>so</i> pretty," concluded Drina, nodding thoughtfully in the
effort to remember more; "Uncle Philip, where is she now?"</p>
<p>But her uncle seemed to have lost his voice as well as his
colour, and Mrs. Gerard's gloved fingers tightened on the lapels of
his coat.</p>
<p>"Drina&mdash;child&mdash;" she faltered; but Drina, immersed in
reflection, smiled dreamily; "So pretty," she murmured; "I remember
my Aunt Alixe&mdash;"</p>
<p>"Drina!" repeated her mother sharply, "go and find Bridget this
minute!"</p>
<p>Selwyn's hesitating hand sought his moustache; he lifted his
eyes&mdash;the steady gray eyes, slightly bloodshot&mdash;to his
sister's distressed face.</p>
<p>"I never dreamed&mdash;" she began&mdash;"the child has never
spoken of&mdash;of her from that time to this! I never dreamed she
could remember&mdash;"</p>
<p>"I don't understand what you are talking about, mother," said
Drina; but her pretty mother caught her by the shoulders, striving
to speak lightly; "Where in the world is Bridget, child? Where is
Katie? And what is all this I hear from Dawson? It can't be
possible that you have been fox-hunting all over the house again!
Your nurses know perfectly well that you are not to hunt anywhere
except in your own nursery."</p>
<p>"I know it," said Drina, "but Kit-Ki got out and ran downstairs.
We had to follow her, you know, until she went to earth."</p>
<p>Selwyn quietly bent over toward Billy: "'Ware wire, my friend,"
he said under his breath; "<i>you'd</i> better cut upstairs and
unlock that schoolroom."</p>
<p>And while Mrs. Gerard turned her attention to the cluster of
clamouring younger children, the boy vanished only to reappear a
moment later, retreating before the vengeful exclamations of the
lately imprisoned nurses who pursued him, caps and aprons flying,
bewailing aloud their ignominious incarceration.</p>
<p>"Billy!" exclaimed his mother, "<i>did</i> you do that? Bridget,
Master William is to take supper by himself in the
schoolroom&mdash;and <i>no</i> marmalade!&mdash;No, Billy, not one
drop!"</p>
<p>"We all saw him lock the door," said Drina honestly.</p>
<p>"And you let him? Oh, Drina!&mdash;And Ellen! Katie! No
marmalade for Miss Drina&mdash;none for any of the children. Josie,
mother feels dreadfully because you all have been so naughty.
Winthrop!&mdash;your finger! Instantly! Clemence, baby, where on
earth did you acquire all that grime on your face and fists?" And
to her brother: "Such a household, Phil! Everybody
incompetent&mdash;including me; everything topsy-turvy; and all
five dogs perfectly possessed to lie on that pink rug in the music
room.&mdash;<i>Have</i> they been there to-day, Drina?&mdash;while
you were practising?"</p>
<p>"Yes, and there are some new spots, mother. I'm <i>very</i>
sorry."</p>
<p>"Take the children away!" said Mrs. Gerard. But she bent over,
kissing each culprit as the file passed out, convoyed by the amply
revenged nurses. "No marmalade, remember; and mother has a great
mind <i>not</i> to come up at bedtime and lean over you. Mother has
no desire to lean over her babies to-night."</p>
<p>To "lean over" the children was always expected of this mother;
the direst punishment on the rather brief list was to omit this
intimate evening ceremony.</p>
<p>"M-mother," stammered the Master of Fox Hounds, "you <i>will</i>
lean over us, won't you?"</p>
<p>"Mother hasn't decided&mdash;"</p>
<p>"Oh, muvver!" wailed Josie; and a howl of grief and dismay rose
from Winthrop, modified to a gurgle by the forbidden finger.</p>
<p>"You <i>will</i>, won't you?" begged Drina. "We've been pretty
bad, but not bad enough for that!"</p>
<p>"I&mdash;Oh, yes, I will. Stop that noise, Winthrop! Josie, I'm
going to lean over you&mdash;and you, too, Clemence, baby. Katie,
take those dogs away immediately; and remember about the
marmalade."</p>
<p>Reassured, smiling through tears, the children trooped off, it
being the bathing hour; and Mrs. Gerard threw her fur stole over
one shoulder and linked her slender arm in her brother's.</p>
<p>"You see, I'm not much of a mother," she said; "if I was I'd
stay here all day and every day, week in and year out, and try to
make these poor infants happy. I have no business to leave them for
one second!"</p>
<p>"Wouldn't they get too much of you?" suggested Selwyn.</p>
<p>"Thanks. I suppose that even a mother had better practise an
artistic absence occasionally. Are they not sweet? <i>What</i> do
you think of them? You never before saw the three youngest; you saw
Drina when you went east&mdash;and Billy was a few months
old&mdash;what do you think of them? Honestly, Phil?"</p>
<p>"All to the good, Ninette; very ornamental. Drina&mdash;and that
Josephine kid are real beauties. I&mdash;er&mdash;take to Billy
tremendously. He told me that he'd locked up his nurses. I ought to
have interfered. It was really my fault, you see."</p>
<p>"And you didn't make him let them out? You are not going to be
very good morally for my young. Tell me, Phil, have you seen
Austin?"</p>
<p>"I went to the Trust Company, but he was attending a directors'
confab. How is he? He's prosperous anyhow, I observe," with a
humorous glance around the elaborate hallway which they were
traversing.</p>
<p>"Don't dare laugh at us!" smiled his sister. "I wish we were
back in Tenth Street. But so many children came&mdash;Billy,
Josephine, Winthrop, and Tina&mdash;and the Tenth Street house
wasn't half big enough; and a dreadful speculative builder built
this house and persuaded Austin to buy it. Oh, dear, and here we
are among the rich and great; and the steel kings and copper kings
and oil kings and their heirs and dauphins. <i>Do</i> you like the
house?"</p>
<p>"It's&mdash;ah&mdash;roomy," he said cheerfully.</p>
<p>"Oh! It isn't so bad from the outside. And we have just had it
redecorated inside. Mizner did it. Look, dear, isn't that a cunning
bedroom?" drawing him toward a partly open door. "Don't be so
horridly critical. Austin is becoming used to it now, so don't stir
him up and make fun of things. Anyway you're going to stay
here."</p>
<p>"No, I'm at the Holland."</p>
<p>"Of <i>course</i> you're to live with us. You've resigned from
the service, haven't you?"</p>
<p>He looked at her sharply, but did not reply.</p>
<p>A curious flash of telepathy passed between them; she hesitated,
then:</p>
<p>"You once promised Austin and me that you would stay with
us."</p>
<p>"But, Nina&mdash;"</p>
<p>"No, no, no! Wait," pressing an electric button; "Watson,
Captain Selwyn's luggage is to be brought here immediately from the
Holland! Immediately!" And to Selwyn: "Austin will not be at home
before half-past six. Come up with me now and see your
quarters&mdash;a perfectly charming place for you, with your own
smoking-room and dressing-closet and bath. Wait, we'll take the
elevator&mdash;as long as we have one."</p>
<p>Smilingly protesting, yet touched by the undisguised sincerity
of his welcome, he suffered himself to be led into the
elevator&mdash;a dainty white and rose rococo affair. His sister
adjusted a tiny lever; the car moved smoothly upward and, presently
stopped; and they emerged upon a wide landing.</p>
<p>"Here," said Nina, throwing open a door. "Isn't this
comfortable? Is there anything you don't fancy about it? If there
is, tell me frankly."</p>
<p>"Little sister," he said, imprisoning both her hands, "it is a
paradise&mdash;but I don't intend to come here and squat on my
relatives, and I won't!"</p>
<p>"Philip! You are common!"</p>
<p>"Oh, I know you and Austin <i>think</i> you want me."</p>
<p>"Phil!"</p>
<p>"All right, dear. I'll&mdash;it's awfully generous of
you&mdash;so I'll pay you a visit&mdash;for a little while."</p>
<p>"You'll live here, that's what you'll do&mdash;though I suppose
you are dreaming and scheming to have all sorts of secret caves and
queer places to yourself&mdash;horrid, grimy, smoky bachelor
quarters where you can behave <i>sans-fa&ccedil;on</i>."</p>
<p>"I've had enough of <i>sans-fa&ccedil;on</i>" he said grimly.
"After shacks and bungalows and gun-boats and troopships, do you
suppose this doesn't look rather heavenly?"</p>
<p>"Dear fellow!" she said, looking tenderly at him; and then under
her breath: "What a ghastly life you have led!"</p>
<p>But he knew she did not refer to the military portion of his
life.</p>
<p>He threw back his coat, dug both hands into his pockets, and
began to wander about the rooms, halting sometimes to examine
nondescript articles of ornament or bits of furniture as though
politely interested. But she knew his thoughts were steadily
elsewhere.</p>

<b>"'There is no reason,' she said, 'why you should not call this
house home.'"</b>
<br /></div>
<p>Sauntering about, aware at moments that her troubled eyes were
following him, he came back, presently, to where she sat perched
upon his bed.</p>
<p>"It all looks most inviting, Nina," he said cheerfully, seating
himself beside her. "I&mdash;well, you can scarcely be expected to
understand how this idea of a home takes hold of a man who has
none."</p>
<p>"Yes, I do," she said.</p>
<p>"All this&mdash;" he paused, leisurely, to select his
words&mdash;"all this&mdash;you&mdash;the children&mdash;that jolly
nursery&mdash;" he stopped again, looking out of the window; and
his sister looked at him through eyes grown misty.</p>
<p>"There is no reason," she said, "why you should not call this
house home."</p>
<p>"N-no reason. Thank you. I will&mdash;for a few days."</p>
<p>"<i>No</i> reason, dear," she insisted. "We are your own people;
we are all you have, Phil!&mdash;the children adore you already;
Austin&mdash;you know what he thinks of you; and&mdash;and
I&mdash;"</p>
<p>"You are very kind, Ninette." He sat partly turned from her,
staring at the sunny window. Presently he slid his hand back along
the bed-covers until it touched and tightened over hers. And in
silence she raised it to her lips.</p>
<p>They remained so for a while, he still partly turned from her,
his perplexed and narrowing gaze fixed on the window, she pressing
his clenched hand to her lips, thoughtful and silent.</p>
<p>"Before Austin comes," he said at length, "let's get the thing
over&mdash;and buried&mdash;as long as it will stay buried."</p>
<p>"Yes, dear."</p>
<p>"Well, then&mdash;then&mdash;" but his throat closed tight with
the effort.</p>
<p>"Alixe is here," she said gently; "did you know it?"</p>
<p>He nodded.</p>
<p>"You know, of course, that she's married Jack Ruthven?"</p>
<p>He nodded again.</p>
<p>"Are you on leave, Phil, or have you really resigned?"</p>
<p>"Resigned."</p>
<p>"I knew it," she sighed.</p>
<p>He said: "As I did not defend the suit I couldn't remain in the
service. There's too much said about us, anyway&mdash;about us who
are appointed from civil life. And then&mdash;to have <i>that</i>
happen!"</p>
<p>"Phil?"</p>
<p>"What?"</p>
<p>"Will you answer me one thing?"</p>
<p>"Yes, I guess so."</p>
<p>"Do you still care for&mdash;her?"</p>
<p>"I am sorry for her."</p>
<p>After a painful silence his sister said: "Could you tell me how
it began, Phil?"</p>
<p>"How it began? I don't know that, either. When Bannard's command
took the field I went with the scouts. Alixe remained in Manila.
Ruthven was there for Fane, Harmon &amp; Co. That's how it began, I
suppose; and it's a rotten climate for morals; and that's how it
began."</p>
<p>"Only that?"</p>
<p>"We had had differences. It's been one misunderstanding after
another. If you mean was I mixed up with another woman&mdash;no!
She knew that."</p>
<p>"She was very young, Phil."</p>
<p>He nodded: "I don't blame her."</p>
<p>"Couldn't anything have been done?"</p>
<p>"If it could, neither she nor I did it&mdash;or knew how to do
it, I suppose. It went wrong from the beginning; it was founded on
froth&mdash;she had been engaged to Harmon, and she threw him over
for 'Boots' Lansing. Then I came along&mdash;Boots behaved like a
thoroughbred&mdash;that is all there is to it&mdash;inexperience,
romance, trouble&mdash;a quick beginning, a quick parting, and two
more fools to give the lie to civilization, and justify the West
Pointers in their opinions of civil appointees."</p>
<p>"Try not to be so bitter, Phil; did you know she was going
before she left Manila?"</p>
<p>"I hadn't the remotest idea of the affair. I thought that we
were trying to learn something about life and about each other. . .
. Then that climax came."</p>
<p>He turned and stared out of the window, dropping his sister's
hand. "She couldn't stand me, she couldn't stand the life, the
climate, the inconveniences, the absence of what she was accustomed
to. She was dead tired of it all. I can understand that. And
I&mdash;I didn't know what to do about it. . . . So we drifted; and
the catastrophe came very quickly. Let me tell you something; a
West Pointer, an Annapolis man, knows what sort of life he's going
into and what he is to expect when he marries. Usually, too, he
marries into the Army or Navy set; and the girl knows, too, what
kind of a married life that means.</p>
<p>"But I didn't. Neither did Alixe. And we went under; that's
all&mdash;fighting each other heart and soul to the end. . . . Is
she happy with Ruthven? I never knew him&mdash;and never cared to.
I suppose they go about in town among the yellow set. Do they?"</p>
<p>"Yes. I've met Alixe once or twice. She was perfectly
composed&mdash;formal but unembarrassed. She has shifted her milieu
somewhat&mdash;it began with the influx of Ruthven's friends from
the 'yellow' section of the younger married set&mdash;the Orchils,
Fanes, Minsters, and Delmour-Carnes. Which is all right if she'd
stay there. But in town you're likely to encounter anybody where
the somebodies of one set merge into the somebodies of another. And
we're always looking over our fences, you know. . . . By the way,"
she added cheerfully, "I'm dipping into the younger set myself
to-night&mdash;on Eileen's account. I brought her out Thursday and
I'm giving a dinner for her to-night."</p>
<p>"Who's Eileen?" he asked.</p>
<p>"Eileen? Why, don't you&mdash;why, of <i>course</i>, you don't
know yet that I've taken Eileen for my own. I didn't want to write
you; I wanted first to see how it would turn out; and when I saw
that it was turning out perfectly, I thought it better to wait
until you could return and hear all about it from me, because one
can't write that sort of thing&mdash;"</p>
<p>"Nina!"</p>
<p>"What, dear?" she said, startled.</p>
<p>"Who the dickens <i>is</i> Eileen?"</p>
<p>"Philip! You are precisely like Austin; you grow impatient of
preliminary details when I'm doing my very best attempting to
explain just as clearly as I can. Now I will go on and say that
Eileen is Molly Erroll's daughter, and the courts appointed Austin
and me guardians for her and for her brother Gerald."</p>
<p>"Oh!"</p>
<p>"Now is it clear to you?"</p>
<p>"Yes," he said, thinking of the tragedy which had left the child
so utterly alone in the world, save for her brother and a distant
kinship by marriage with the Gerards.</p>
<p>For a while he sat brooding, arms loosely folded, immersed once
more in his own troubles.</p>
<p>"It seems a shame," he said, "that a family like ours, whose
name has always spelled decency, should find themselves entangled
in the very things their race has always hated and managed to
avoid. And through me, too."</p>
<p>"It was not your fault, Phil."</p>
<p>"No, not the divorce part. Do you suppose I wouldn't have taken
any kind of medicine before resorting to that! But what's the use;
for you can try as you may to keep your name clean, and then you
can fold your arms and wait to see what a hopeless fool fate makes
of you."</p>
<p>"But no disgrace touches you, dear," she said tremulously.</p>
<p>"I've been all over that, too," he said with quiet bitterness.
"You are partly right; nobody cares in this town. Even though I did
not defend the suit, nobody cares. And there's no disgrace, I
suppose, if nobody cares enough even to condone. Divorce is no
longer noticed; it is a matter of ordinary occurrence&mdash;a
matter of routine in some sets. Who cares?&mdash;except decent
folk? And they only think it's a pity&mdash;and wouldn't do it
themselves. The horrified clamour comes from outside the social
registers and blue books; we know they're right, but it doesn't
affect us. What does affect us is that we <i>were</i> the decent
folk who permitted ourselves the luxury of being sorry for others
who resorted to divorce as a remedy but wouldn't do it ourselves! .
. . Now we've done it and&mdash;"</p>
<p>"Phil! I will not have you feel that way."</p>
<p>"What way?"</p>
<p>"The way you feel. We are older than we were&mdash;everybody is
older&mdash;the world is, too. What we were brought up to consider
impossible&mdash;"</p>
<p>"What we were brought up to consider impossible was what kept me
up to the mark out there, Nina." He made a gesture toward the East.
"Now, I come back here and learn that we've all outgrown those
ideas&mdash;"</p>
<p>"Phil! I never meant that."</p>
<p>He said: "If Alixe found that she cared for Ruthven, I don't
blame her. Laws and statutes can't govern such matters. If she
found she no longer cared for me, I could not blame her. But two
people, mismated, have only one chance in this world&mdash;to live
their tragedy through with dignity. That is absolutely all life
holds for them. Beyond that, outside of that dead
line&mdash;treachery to self and race and civilisation! That is my
conclusion after a year's experience in hell." He rose and began to
pace the floor, fingers worrying his moustache. "Law? Can a law,
which I do not accept, let me loose to risk it all again with
another woman?"</p>
<p>She said slowly, her hands folded in her lap: "It is well you've
come to me at last. You've been turning round and round in that
wheeled cage until you think you've made enormous progress; and you
haven't. Dear, listen to me; what you honestly believe to be
unselfish and high-minded adherence to principle, is nothing but
the circling reasoning of a hurt mind&mdash;an intelligence still
numbed from shock, a mental and physical life forced by sheer
courage into mechanical routine. . . . Wait a moment; there is
nobody else to say this to you; and if I did not love you I would
not interfere with this great mistake you are so honestly making of
your life, and which, perhaps, is the only comfort left you. I say,
'perhaps,' for I do not believe that life holds nothing happier for
you than the sullen content of martyrdom."</p>
<p>"Nina!"</p>
<p>"I am right!" she said, almost fiercely; "I've been married
thirteen years and I've lost that fear of men's portentous
judgments which all girls outgrow one day. And do you think I am
going to acquiesce in this attitude of yours toward life? Do you
think I can't distinguish between a tragical mistake and a mistaken
tragedy? I tell you your life is not finished; it is not yet
begun!"</p>
<p>He looked at her, incensed; but she sprang to the floor, her
face bright with colour, her eyes clear, determined: "I thought,
when you took the oath of military service, you swore to obey the
laws of the land? And the very first law that interferes with your
preconceived notions&mdash;crack!&mdash;you say it's not for you!
Look at me&mdash;you great, big, wise brother of mine&mdash;who
knows enough to march a hundred and three men into battle, but not
enough to know where pride begins and conscience ends. You're badly
hurt; you are deeply humiliated over your resignation; you believe
that ambition for a career, for happiness, for marriage, and for
children is ended for you. You need fresh air&mdash;and I'm going
to see you have it. You need new duties, new faces, new scenes, new
problems. You shall have them. Dear, believe me, few men as young
as you&mdash;as attractive, as human, as lovable, as affectionate
as you, wilfully ruin their lives because of a hurt pride which
they mistake for conscience. You will understand that when you
become convalescent. Now kiss me and tell me you're much
obliged&mdash;for I hear Austin's voice on the stairs."</p>
<p>He held her at arms' length, gazing at her, half amused, half
indignant; then, unbidden, a second flash of the old telepathy
passed between them&mdash;a pale glimmer lighted his own dark heart
in sympathy; and for a moment he seemed to have a brief glimpse of
the truth; and the truth was not as he had imagined it. But it was
a glimpse only&mdash;a fleeting suspicion of his own fallibility;
then it vanished into the old, dull, aching, obstinate humiliation.
For truth would not be truth if it were so easily discovered.</p>
<p>"Well, we've buried it now," breathed Selwyn. "You're all right,
Nina&mdash;from your own standpoint&mdash;and I'm not going to make
a stalking nuisance of myself; no fear, little sister.
Hello!"&mdash;turning swiftly&mdash;"here's that preposterous
husband of yours."</p>
<p>They exchanged a firm hand clasp; Austin Gerard, big, smooth
shaven, humorously inclined toward the ruddy heaviness of
successful middle age; Selwyn, lean, bronzed, erect, and direct in
all the powerful symmetry and perfect health of a man within sight
of maturity.</p>
<p>"Hail to the chief&mdash;et cetera," said Austin, in his large,
bantering voice. "Glad to see you home, my bolo-punctured soldier
boy. Welcome to our city! I suppose you've both pockets stuffed
with loot, now haven't you?&mdash;pearls and sarongs and
dattos&mdash;yes? Have you inspected the kids? What's your opinion
of the Gerard batallion? Pretty fit? Nina's commanding, so it's up
to her if we don't pass dress parade. By the way, your enormous
luggage is here&mdash;consisting of one dinky trunk and a sword
done up in chamois skin."</p>
<p>"Nina's good enough to want me for a few days&mdash;" began
Selwyn, but his big brother-in-law laughed scornfully:</p>
<p>"A few days! We've got you now!" And to his wife: "Nina, I
suppose I'm due to lean over those infernal kids before I can have
a minute with your brother. Are they in bed yet? All right, Phil;
we'll be down in a minute; there's tea and things in the library.
Make Eileen give you some."</p>
<p>He turned, unaffectedly taking his pretty wife's hand in his
large florid paw, and Selwyn, intensely amused, saw them making for
the nursery absorbed in conjugal confab. He lingered to watch them
go their way, until they disappeared; and he stood a moment longer
alone there in the hallway; then the humour faded from his
sun-burnt face; he swung wearily on his heel, and descended the
stairway, his hand heavy on the velvet rail.</p>
<p>The library was large and comfortable, full of agreeably wadded
corners and fat, helpless chairs&mdash;a big, inviting place,
solidly satisfying in dull reds and mahogany. The porcelain of tea
paraphernalia caught the glow of the fire; a reading lamp burned on
a centre table, shedding subdued lustre over ceiling, walls, books,
and over the floor where lay a few ancient rugs of Beloochistan,
themselves full of mysterious, sombre fire.</p>
<p>Hands clasped behind his back, he stood in the centre of the
room, considering his environment with the grave, absent air
habitual to him when brooding. And, as he stood there, a sound at
the door aroused him, and he turned to confront a young girl in
hat, veil, and furs, who was leisurely advancing toward him,
stripping the gloves from a pair of very white hands.</p>
<p>"How do you do, Captain Selwyn," she said. "I am Eileen Erroll
and I am commissioned to give you some tea. Nina and Austin are in
the nursery telling bedtime stories and hearing assorted prayers.
The children seem to be quite crazy about you&mdash;" She
unfastened her veil, threw back stole and coat, and, rolling up her
gloves on her wrists, seated herself by the table.
"&mdash;<i>Quite</i> crazy about you," she continued, "and you're
to be included in bedtime prayers, I believe&mdash;No sugar?
Lemon?&mdash;Drina's mad about you and threatens to give you her
new maltese puppy. I congratulate you on your popularity."</p>
<p>"Did you see me in the nursery on all fours?" inquired Selwyn,
recognising her bronze-red hair.</p>
<p>Unfeigned laughter was his answer. He laughed, too, not very
heartily.</p>
<p>"My first glimpse of our legendary nursery warrior was certainly
astonishing," she said, looking around at him with frank malice.
Then, quickly: "But you don't mind, do you? It's all in the family,
of course."</p>
<p>"Of course," he agreed with good grace; "no use to pretend
dignity here; you all see through me in a few moments."</p>
<p>She had given him his tea. Now she sat upright in her chair,
smiling, <i>distraite</i>, her hat casting a luminous shadow across
her eyes; the fluffy furs, fallen from throat and shoulder, settled
loosely around her waist.</p>
<p>Glancing up from her short reverie she encountered his curious
gaze.</p>
<p>"To-night is to be my first dinner dance, you know," she said.
Faint tints of excitement stained her white skin; the vivid scarlet
contrast of her mouth was almost startling. "On Thursday I was
introduced&mdash;" she explained, "and now I'm to have the gayest
winter I ever dreamed of. . . . And I'm going to leave you in a
moment if Nina doesn't hurry and come. Do you mind?"</p>
<p>"Of course I mind," he protested amiably, "but I suppose you
wish to devote several hours to dressing."</p>
<p>She nodded. "Such a dream of a gown! Nina's present! You'll see
it. I hope Gerald will be here to see it. He promised. You'll say
you like it if you do like it, won't you?"</p>
<p>"I'll say it, anyway."</p>
<p>"Oh, well&mdash;if you are contented to be commonplace like
other men&mdash;"</p>
<p>"I've no ambition to be different at my age."</p>
<p>"Your age?" she repeated, looking up quickly. "You are as young
as Nina, aren't you? Half the men in the younger set are no younger
than you&mdash;and you know it," she concluded&mdash;"you are only
trying to make me say so&mdash;and you've succeeded. I'm not very
experienced yet. Does tea bring wisdom, Captain Selwyn?" pouring
herself a cup. "I'd better arm myself immediately." She sank back
into the depths of the chair, looking gaily at him over her lifted
cup. "To my rapid education in worldly wisdom!" She nodded, and
sipped the tea almost pensively.</p>
<p>He certainly did seem young there in the firelight, his narrow,
thoroughbred head turned toward the fire. Youth, too, sat lightly
on his shoulders; and it was scarcely a noticeably mature hand that
touched the short sun-burnt moustache at intervals. From head to
waist, from his loosely coupled, well-made limbs to his strong,
slim foot, strength seemed to be the keynote to a physical harmony
most agreeable to look at.</p>
<p>The idea entered her head that he might appear to advantage on
horseback.</p>
<p>"We must ride together," she said, returning her teacup to the
tray; "if you don't mind riding with me? Do you? Gerald never has
time, so I go with a groom. But if you would care to go&mdash;" she
laughed. "Oh, you see I am already beginning a selfish family claim
on you. I foresee that you'll be very busy with us all persistently
tugging at your coat-sleeves; and what with being civil to me and a
martyr to Drina, you'll have very little time to yourself.
And&mdash;I hope you'll like my brother Gerald when you meet him.
Now I <i>must</i> go."</p>
<p>Then, rising and partly turning to collect her furs:</p>
<p>"It's quite exciting to have you here. We will be good friends,
won't we? . . . and I think I had better stop my chatter and go,
because my cunning little Alsatian maid is not very clever yet. . .
. Good-bye."</p>
<p>She stretched out one of her amazingly white hands across the
table, giving him a friendly leave-taking and welcome all in one
frank handshake; and left him standing there, the fresh contact
still cool in his palm.</p>
<p>Nina came in presently to find him seated before the fire, one
hand shading his eyes; and, as he prepared to rise, she rested both
arms on his shoulders, forcing him into his chair again.</p>
<p>"So you've bewitched Eileen, too, have you?" she said tenderly.
"Isn't she the sweetest little thing?"</p>
<p>"She's&mdash;ah&mdash;as tall as I am," he said, blinking at the
fire.</p>
<p>"She's only nineteen; pathetically unspoiled&mdash;a perfect
dear. Men are going to rave over her and&mdash;<i>not</i> spoil
her. Did you ever see such hair?&mdash;that thick, ruddy, lustrous,
copper tint?&mdash;and sometimes it's like gold afire. And a skin
like snow and peaches!&mdash;she's sound to the core. I've had her
exercised and groomed and hardened and trained from the very
beginning&mdash;every inch of her minutely cared for exactly like
my own babies. I've done my best," she concluded with a satisfied
sigh, and dropped into a chair beside her brother.</p>
<p>"Thoroughbred," commented Selwyn, "to be turned out to-night. Is
she bridle-wise and intelligent?"</p>
<p>"More than sufficiently. That's one trouble&mdash;she's had, at
times, a depressing, sponge-like desire for absorbing all sorts of
irrelevant things that no girl ought to concern herself with.
I&mdash;to tell the truth&mdash;if I had not rigorously drilled
her&mdash;she might have become a trifle tiresome; I don't mean
precisely frumpy&mdash;but one of those earnest young things whose
intellectual conversation becomes a visitation&mdash;one of the
wants-to-know-for-the-sake-of-knowledge sort&mdash;a dreadful human
blotter! Oh, dear; show me a girl with her mind soaking up 'isms'
and I'll show you a social failure with a wisp of hair on her
cheek, who looks the dowdier the more expensively she's
gowned."</p>
<p>"So you believe you've got that wisp of copper-tinted hair
tucked up snugly?" asked Selwyn, amused.</p>
<p>"I&mdash;it's still a worry to me; at intervals she's inclined
to let it slop. Thank Heaven, I've made her spine permanently
straight and her head is screwed properly to her neck. There's not
a slump to her from crown to heel&mdash;<i>I</i> know, you know.
She's had specialists to forestall every blemish. I made up my mind
to do it; I'm doing it for my own babies. That's what a mother is
for&mdash;to turn out her offspring to the world as flawless and
wholesome as when they came into it!&mdash;physically and mentally
sound&mdash;or a woman betrays her stewardship. They must be as
healthy of body and limb as they are innocent and wholesome minded.
The happiest of all creatures are drilled thoroughbreds. Show me a
young girl, unspoiled mentally and spiritually untroubled, with a
superb physique, and I'll show you a girl equipped for the
happiness of this world. And that is what Eileen is."</p>
<p>"I should say," observed Selwyn, "that she's equipped for the
slaughter of man."</p>
<p>"Yes, but <i>I</i> am selecting the victim," replied his sister
demurely.</p>
<p>"Oh! Have you? Already?"</p>
<p>"Tentatively."</p>
<p>"Who?"</p>
<p>"Sudbury Gray, I think&mdash;with Scott Innis for an
understudy&mdash;perhaps the Draymore man as alternate&mdash;I
don't know; there's time."</p>
<p>"Plenty," he said vaguely, staring into the fire where a log had
collapsed into incandescent ashes.</p>
<p>She continued to talk about Eileen until she noticed that his
mind was on other matters&mdash;his preoccupied stare enlightened
her. She said nothing for a while.</p>
<p>But he woke up when Austin came in and settled his big body in a
chair.</p>
<p>"Drina, the little minx, called me back on some flimsy pretext,"
he said, relighting his cigar; "I forgot that time was
going&mdash;and she was wily enough to keep me talking until Miss
Paisely caught me at it and showed me out. I tell you," turning on
Selwyn&mdash;"children are what make life worth wh&mdash;" He
ceased abruptly at a gentle tap from his wife's foot, and Selwyn
looked up.</p>
<p>Whether or not he divined the interference he said very quietly:
"I'd rather have had children than anything in the world. They're
about the best there is in life; I agree with you, Austin."</p>
<p>His sister, watching him askance, was relieved to see his
troubled face become serene, though she divined the effort.</p>
<p>"Kids are the best," he repeated, smiling at her. "Failing them,
for second choice, I've taken to the laboratory. Some day I'll
invent something and astonish you, Nina."</p>
<p>"We'll fit you up a corking laboratory," began Austin cordially;
"there is&mdash;"</p>
<p>"You're very good; perhaps you'll all be civil enough to move
out of the house if I need more room for bottles and
retorts&mdash;"</p>
<p>"Of <i>course</i>, Phil must have his laboratory," insisted
Nina. "There's loads of unused room in this big barn&mdash;only you
don't mind being at the top of the house, do you, Phil?"</p>
<p>"Yes, I do; I want to be in the drawing-room&mdash;or somewhere
so that you all may enjoy the odours and get the benefit of
premature explosions. Oh, come now, Austin, if you think I'm going
to plant myself here on you&mdash;"</p>
<p>"Don't notice him, Austin," said Nina, "he only wishes to be
implored. And, by the same token, you'd both better let me implore
you to dress!" She rose and bent forward in the firelight to peer
at the clock. "Goodness! Do you creatures think I'm going to give
Eileen half an hour's start with her maid?&mdash;and I carrying my
twelve years' handicap, too. No, indeed! I'm decrepit but I'm going
to die fighting. Austin, get up! You're horribly slow, anyhow.
Phil, Austin's man&mdash;such as he is&mdash;will be at your
disposal, and your luggage is unpacked."</p>
<p>"Am I really expected to grace this festival of babes?" inquired
Selwyn. "Can't you send me a tray of toast or a bowl of gruel and
let me hide my old bones in a dressing-gown somewhere?"</p>
<p>"Oh, come on," said Austin, smothering the yawn in his voice and
casting his cigar into the ashes. "You're about ripe for the
younger set&mdash;one of them, anyhow. If you can't stand the
intellectual strain we'll side-step the show later and play a
little&mdash;what do you call it in the army?&mdash;pontoons?"</p>
<p>They strolled toward the door, Nina's arms linked in theirs, her
slim fingers interlocked on her breast.</p>
<p>"We are certainly going to be happy&mdash;we three&mdash;in this
innocent <i>m&eacute;nage &agrave; trois</i>," she said. "I don't
know what more you two men could ask for&mdash;or I,
either&mdash;or the children or Eileen. Only one thing; I think it
is perfectly horrid of Gerald not to be here."</p>
<p>Traversing the hall she said: "It always frightens me to be
perfectly happy&mdash;and remember all the ghastly things that
<i>could</i> happen. . . . I'm going to take a glance at the
children before I dress. . . . Austin, did you remember your
tonic?"</p>
<p>She looked up surprised when her husband laughed.</p>
<p>"I've taken my tonic and nobody's kidnapped the kids," he said.
She hesitated, then picking up her skirts she ran upstairs for one
more look at her slumbering progeny.</p>
<p>The two men glanced at one another; their silence was the
tolerant, amused silence of the wiser sex, posing as such for each
other's benefit; but deep under the surface stirred the tremors of
the same instinctive solicitude that had sent Nina to the
nursery.</p>
<p>"I used to think," said Gerard, "that the more kids you had the
less anxiety per kid. The contrary is true; you're more nervous
over half a dozen than you are over one, and your wife is always
going to the nursery to see that the cat hasn't got in or the place
isn't afire or spots haven't come out all over the children."</p>
<p>They laughed tolerantly, lingering on the sill of Selwyn's
bedroom.</p>
<p>"Come in and smoke a cigarette," suggested the latter. "I have
nothing to do except to write some letters and dress."</p>
<p>But Gerard said: "There seems to be a draught through this
hallway; I'll just step upstairs to be sure that the nursery
windows are not too wide open. See you later, Phil. If there's
anything you need just dingle that bell."</p>
<p>And he went away upstairs, only to return in a few minutes,
laughing under his breath: "I say, Phil, don't you want to see the
kids asleep? Billy's flat on his back with a white 'Teddy bear' in
either arm; and Drina and Josephine are rolled up like two kittens
in pajamas; and you should see Winthrop's legs&mdash;"</p>
<p>"Certainly," said Selwyn gravely, "I'll be with you in a
second."</p>
<p>And turning to his dresser he laid away the letters and the
small photograph which he had been examining under the drop-light,
locking them securely in the worn despatch box until he should have
time to decide whether to burn them all or only the picture. Then
he slipped on his smoking jacket.</p>
<p>"&mdash;Ah, about Winthrop's legs&mdash;" he repeated vaguely,
"certainly; I should be very glad to examine them, Austin."</p>
<p>"I don't want you to examine them," retorted Gerard resentfully,
"I want you to see them. There's nothing the matter with them, you
understand."</p>
<p>"Exactly," nodded Selwyn, following his big brother-in-law into
the hall, where, from beside a lamp-lit sewing table a trim maid
rose smiling:</p>
<p>"Miss Erroll desires to know whether Captain Selwyn would care
to see her gown when she is ready to go down?"</p>
<p>"By all means," said Selwyn, "I should like to see that, too.
Will you let me know when Miss Erroll is ready? Thank you."</p>
<p>Austin said as they reached the nursery door: "Funny thing,
feminine vanity&mdash;almost pathetic, isn't it? . . . Don't make
too much noise! . . . What do you think of that pair of legs,
Phil?&mdash;and he's not yet five. . . . And I want you to speak
frankly; <i>did</i> you ever see anything to beat that bunch of
infants? Not because they're ours and we happen to be your own
people&mdash;" he checked himself and the smile faded as he laid
his big ruddy hand on Selwyn's shoulder;&mdash;"<i>your own
people</i>, Phil. Do you understand? . . . And if I have not
ventured to say anything about&mdash;what has happened&mdash;you
understand that, too, don't you? You know I'm just as loyal to you
as Nina is&mdash;as it is natural and fitting that your own people
should be. Only a man finds it difficult to convey
his&mdash;his&mdash;"</p>
<p>"Don't say 'sympathies'!" cut in Selwyn nervously.</p>
<p>"I wasn't going to, confound you! I was going to say
'sentiments.' I'm sorry I said anything. Go to the deuce!"</p>
<p>Selwyn did not even deign to glance around at him. "You big
red-pepper box," he muttered affectionately, "you'll wake up Drina.
Look at her in her cunning pajamas! Oh, but she is a darling,
Austin. And look at that boy with his two white bears! He's a
corker! He's a wonder&mdash;honestly, Austin. As for that Josephine
kid she can have me on demand; I'll answer to voice, whistle, or
hand. . . . I say, ought we to go away and leave Winthrop's thumb
in his mouth?"</p>
<p>"I guess I can get it out without waking him," whispered Gerard.
A moment later he accomplished the office, leaned down and drew the
bed-covers closer to Tina's dimpled chin, then grasped Selwyn above
the elbow in sudden alarm: "If that trained terror, Miss Paisely,
finds us in here when she comes from dinner, we'll both catch it!
Come on; I'll turn off the light. Anyway, we ought to have been
dressed long ago; but you insisted on butting in here."</p>
<p>In the hallway below they encountered a radiant and bewildering
vision awaiting them: Eileen, in all her glory.</p>
<p>"Wonderful!" said Gerard, patting the vision's rounded bare arm
as he hurried past&mdash;"fine gown! fine girl!&mdash;but I've got
to dress and so has Philip&mdash;" He meant well.</p>
<p>"<i>Do</i> you like it, Captain Selwyn?" asked the girl, turning
to confront him, where he had halted. "Gerald isn't coming
and&mdash;I thought perhaps you'd be interested&mdash;"</p>
<p>The formal, half-patronising compliment on his tongue's tip
remained there, unsaid. He stood silent, touched by the faint
under-ringing wistfulness in the laughing voice that challenged his
opinion; and something within him responded in time:</p>
<p>"Your gown is a beauty; such wonderful lace. Of course, anybody
would know it came straight from Paris or from some other celestial
region&mdash;"</p>
<p>"But it didn't!" cried the girl, delighted. "It looks it,
doesn't it? But it was made by Letellier! Is there anything you
don't like about it, Captain Selwyn? <i>Anything</i>?"</p>
<p>"Nothing," he said solemnly; "it is as adorable as the girl
inside it, who makes it look like a Parisian importation from
Paradise!"</p>
<p>She colored enchantingly, and with pretty, frank impulse held
out both her hands to him:</p>
<p>"You <i>are</i> a dear, Captain Selwyn! It is my first real
dinner gown and I'm quite mad about it; and&mdash;somehow I wanted
the family to share my madness with me. Nina will&mdash;she gave it
to me, the darling. Austin admires it, too, of course, but he
doesn't notice such things very closely; and Gerald isn't here. . .
. Thank you for letting me show it to you before I go down."</p>
<p>She gave both his hands a friendly little shake and, glancing
down at her skirt in blissful consciousness of its perfection,
stepped backward into her own room.</p>
<p>Later, while he stood at his dresser constructing an immaculate
knot in his white tie, Nina knocked.</p>
<p>"Hurry, Phil! Oh, may I come in? . . . You ought to be
downstairs with us, you know. . . . And it was very sweet of you to
be so nice to Eileen. The child had tears in her eyes when I went
in. Oh, just a single diamond drop in each eye; your sympathy and
interest did it. . . . I think the child misses her father on an
occasion such as this&mdash;the beginning of life&mdash;the first
step out into the world. Men do not understand what it means to us;
Gerald doesn't, I'm sure. I've been watching her, and I know the
shadow of that dreadful tragedy falls on her more often than Austin
and I are aware of. . . . Shall I fix that tie for you, dear? . . .
Certainly I can; Austin won't let a man touch him. . . . There,
Phil. . . . Wait! . . . Now if you are decently grateful you'll
tell me I look well. Do I? Really? Nonsense, I <i>don't</i> look
twenty; but&mdash;say it, Phil. Ah, that clever maid of mine knows
some secrets&mdash;never mind!&mdash;but Drina thinks I'm a beauty.
. . . Come, dear; and thank you for being kind to Eileen. One's own
kin counts so much in this world. And when a girl has none, except
a useless brother, little things like that mean a lot to her." She
turned, her hand falling on his sleeve. "<i>You</i> are among your
own people, anyhow!"</p>
<hr style='width: 45%;' />
<p>His own people! The impatient tenderness of his sister's words
had been sounding in his ears all through the evening. They rang
out clear and insistent amid the gay tumult of the dinner; he heard
them in the laughing confusion of youthful voices; they stole into
the delicate undertones of the music to mock him; the rustling of
silk and lace repeated them; the high heels of satin slippers
echoed them in irony.</p>
<p>His own people!</p>
<p>The scent of overheated flowers, the sudden warm breeze eddying
from a capricious fan, the mourning thrill of the violins
emphasised the emphasis of the words.</p>
<p>And they sounded sadder and more meaningless now to him, here in
his own room, until the monotony of their recurrent mockery began
to unnerve him.</p>
<p>He turned on the electricity, shrank from it, extinguished it.
And for a long time he sat there in the darkness of early morning,
his unfilled pipe clutched in his nerveless hand.</p>

<h3>A DREAM ENDS</h3>
<p>To pick up once more and tighten and knot together the loosened
threads which represented the unfinished record that his race had
woven into the social fabric of the metropolis was merely an
automatic matter for Selwyn.</p>
<p>His own people had always been among the makers of that fabric.
Into part of its vast and intricate pattern they had woven an
inconspicuously honourable record&mdash;chronicles of births and
deaths and marriages, a plain memorandum of plain living, and
upright dealing with their fellow men.</p>
<p>Some public service of modest nature they had performed, not
seeking it, not shirking; accomplishing it cleanly when it was
intrusted to them.</p>
<p>His forefathers had been, as a rule, professional
men&mdash;physicians and lawyers; his grandfather died under the
walls of Chapultepec Castle while twisting a tourniquet for a
cursing dragoon; an uncle remained indefinitely at Malvern Hill; an
only brother at Montauk Point having sickened in the trenches
before Santiago.</p>
<p>His father's services as division medical officer in Sheridan's
cavalry had been, perhaps, no more devoted, no more loyal than the
services of thousands of officers and troopers; and his reward was
a pension offer, declined. He practised until his wife died, then
retired to his country home, from which house his daughter Nina was
married to Austin Gerard.</p>
<p>Mr. Selwyn, senior, continued to pay his taxes on his father's
house in Tenth Street, voted in that district, spent a month every
year with the Gerards, read a Republican morning newspaper, and
judiciously enlarged the family reservation in
Greenwood&mdash;whither he retired, in due time, without other
ostentation than half a column in the <i>Evening Post</i>, which
paper he had, in life, avoided.</p>
<p>The first gun off the Florida Keys sent Selwyn's only brother
from his law office in hot haste to San Antonio&mdash;the first
<i>&eacute;tape</i> on his first and last campaign with Wood's
cavalry.</p>
<p>That same gun interrupted Selwyn's connection with Neergard
&amp; Co., operators in Long Island real estate; and, a year later,
the captaincy offered him in a Western volunteer regiment operating
on the Island of Leyte, completed the rupture.</p>
<hr style='width: 45%;' />
<p>And now he was back again, a chance career ended, with option of
picking up the severed threads&mdash;his inheritance at the
loom&mdash;and of retying them, warp and weft, and continuing the
pattern according to the designs of the tufted, tinted pile-yarn,
knotted in by his ancestors before him.</p>
<p>There was nothing else to do; so he did it. Civil and certain
social obligations were mechanically reassumed; he appeared in his
sister's pew for worship, he re&euml;nrolled in his clubs as a
resident member once more; the directors of such charities as he
meddled with he notified of his return; he remitted his dues to the
various museums and municipal or private organisations which had
always expected support from his family; he subscribed to the
<i>Sun</i>.</p>
<p>He was more conservative, however, in mending the purely social
strands so long relaxed or severed. The various registers and
blue-books recorded his residence under "dilatory domiciles"; he
did not subscribe to the opera, preferring to chance it in case
harmony-hunger attacked him; pre-Yuletide functions he dodged,
considering that his sister's days in January and attendance at
other family formalities were sufficient.</p>
<p>Meanwhile he was looking for two things&mdash;an apartment and a
job&mdash;the first energetically combated by his immediate
family.</p>
<p>It was rather odd&mdash;the scarcity of jobs. Of course Austin
offered him one which Selwyn declined at once, comfortably enraging
his brother-in-law for nearly ten minutes.</p>
<p>"But what do I know about the investment of trust funds?"
demanded Selwyn; "you wouldn't take me if I were not your wife's
brother&mdash;and that's nepotism."</p>
<p>Austin's harmless fury raged for nearly ten minutes, after which
he cheered up, relighted his cigar, and resumed his discussion with
Selwyn concerning the merits of various boys' schools&mdash;the
victim in prospective being Billy.</p>
<p>A little later, reverting to the subject of his own enforced
idleness, Selwyn said: "I've been on the point of going to see
Neergard&mdash;but somehow I can't quite bring myself to
it&mdash;slinking into his office as a rank failure in one
profession, to ask him if he has any use for me again."</p>
<p>"Stuff and fancy!" growled Gerard; "it's all stuff and fancy
about your being any kind of a failure. If you want to resume with
that Dutchman, go to him and say so. If you want to invest anything
in his Long Island schemes he'll take you in fast enough. He took
in Gerald and some twenty thousand."</p>
<p>"Isn't he very prosperous, Austin?"</p>
<p>"Very&mdash;on paper. Long Island farm lands and mortgages on
Hampton hen-coops are not fragrant propositions to me. But there's
always one more way of making a living after you counted 'em all up
on your fingers. If you've any capital to offer Neergard, he won't
shriek for help."</p>
<p>"But isn't suburban property&mdash;"</p>
<p>"On the jump? Yes&mdash;both ways. Oh, I suppose that Neergard
is all right&mdash;if he wasn't I wouldn't have permitted Gerald to
go into it. Neergard sticks to his commissions and doesn't back his
fancy in certified checks. I don't know exactly how he operates; I
only know that we find nothing in that sort of thing for our own
account. But Fane, Harmon &amp; Co. do. That's their affair, too;
it's all a matter of taste, I tell you."</p>
<p>Selwyn reflected: "I believe I'd go and see Neergard if I were
perfectly sure of my personal sentiments toward him. . . . He's
been civil enough to me, of course, but I have always had a curious
feeling about Neergard&mdash;that he's for ever on the edge of
doing something&mdash;doubtful&mdash;"</p>
<p>"His business reputation is all right. He shaves the dead line
like a safety razor, but he's never yet cut through it. On
principle, however, look out for an apple-faced Dutchman with a
thin nose and no lips. Neither Jew, Yankee, nor American stands any
chance in a deal with that type of financier. Personally my feeling
is this: if I've got to play games with Julius Neergard, I'd prefer
to be his partner. And so I told Gerald. By the way&mdash;"</p>
<p>Austin checked himself, looked down at his cigar, turned it over
and over several times, then continued quietly:</p>
<p>&mdash;"By the way, I suppose Gerald is like other young men of
his age and times&mdash;immersed in his own
affairs&mdash;thoughtless perhaps, perhaps a trifle selfish in the
cross-country gallop after pleasure. . . . I was rather severe with
him about his neglect of his sister. He ought to have come here to
pay his respects to you, too&mdash;"</p>
<p>"Oh, don't put such notions into his head&mdash;"</p>
<p>"Yes, I will!" insisted Austin; "however indifferent and
thoughtless and selfish he is to other people, he's got to be
considerate toward his own family. And I told him so. Have you seen
him lately?"</p>
<p>"N-o," admitted Selwyn.</p>
<p>"Not since that first time when he came to do the civil by
you?"</p>
<p>"No; but don't&mdash;"</p>
<p>"Yes, I will," repeated his brother-in-law; "and I'm going to
have a thorough explanation with him and learn what he's up to.
He's got to be decent to his sister; he ought to report to me
occasionally; that's all there is to it. He has entirely too much
liberty with his bachelor quarters and his junior whipper-snapper
club, and his house parties and his cruises on Neergard's
boat!"</p>
<p>He got up, casting his cigar from him, and moved about bulkily,
muttering of matters to be regulated, and firmly, too. But Selwyn,
looking out of the window across the Park, knew perfectly well that
young Erroll, now of age, with a small portion of his handsome
income at his mercy, was past the regulating stage and beyond the
authority of Austin. There was no harm in him; he was simply a
joyous, pleasure-loving cub, chock full of energetic instincts,
good and bad, right and wrong, out of which, formed from the acts
which become habits, character matures. This was his estimate of
Gerald.</p>
<hr style='width: 45%;' />
<p>The next morning, riding in the Park with Eileen, he found a
chance to speak cordially of her brother.</p>
<p>"I've meant to look up Gerald," he said, as though the neglect
were his own fault, "but every time something happens to switch me
on to another track."</p>
<p>"I'm afraid that I do a great deal of the switching," she said;
"don't I? But you've been so nice to me and to the children
that&mdash;"</p>
<p>Miss Erroll's horse was behaving badly, and for a few moments
she became too thoroughly occupied with her mount to finish her
sentence.</p>
<p>The belted groom galloped up, prepared for emergencies, and he
and Selwyn sat their saddles watching a pretty battle for mastery
between a beautiful horse determined to be bad and a very
determined young girl who had decided he was going to be good.</p>
<p>Once or twice the excitement of solicitude sent the colour
flying into Selwyn's temples; the bridle-path was narrow and stiff
with freezing sand, and the trees were too near for such lively
manoeuvres; but Miss Erroll had made up her mind&mdash;and Selwyn
already had a humorous idea that this was no light matter. The
horse found it serious enough, too, and suddenly concluded to be
good. And the pretty scene ended so abruptly that Selwyn laughed
aloud as he rejoined her:</p>
<p>"There was a man&mdash;'Boots' Lansing&mdash;in Bannard's
command. One night on Samar the bolo-men rushed us, and Lansing got
into the six-foot major's boots by mistake&mdash;seven-leaguers,
you know&mdash;and his horse bucked him clean out of them."</p>
<p>"Hence his Christian name, I suppose," said the girl; "but why
such a story, Captain Selwyn? I believe I stuck to my saddle?"</p>
<p>"With both hands," he said cordially, always alert to plague
her. For she was adorable when teased&mdash;especially in the
beginning of their acquaintance, before she had found out that it
was a habit of his&mdash;and her bright confusion always delighted
him into further mischief.</p>
<p>"But I wasn't a bit worried," he continued; "you had him so
firmly around the neck. Besides, what horse or man could resist
such a pleading pair of arms around the neck?"</p>
<p>"What you saw," she said, flushing up, "is exactly the way I
shall do any pleading with the two animals you mention."</p>
<p>"Spur and curb and thrash us? Oh, my!"</p>
<p>"Not if you're bridle-wise, Captain Selwyn," she returned
sweetly. "And you know you always are. And sometimes"&mdash;she
crossed her crop and looked around at him
reflectively&mdash;"<i>sometimes</i>, do you know, I am almost
afraid that you are so very, very good, that perhaps you are
becoming almost goody-good."</p>
<p>"<i>What</i>!" he exclaimed indignantly; but his only answer was
her head thrown back and a ripple of enchanting laughter.</p>
<p>Later she remarked: "It's just as Nina says, after all, isn't
it?"</p>
<p>"I suppose so," he replied suspiciously; "what?"</p>
<p>"That Gerald isn't really very wicked, but he likes to have us
think so. It's a sign of extreme self-consciousness, isn't it," she
added innocently, "when a man is afraid that a woman thinks he is
very, very good?"</p>
<p>"That," he said, "is the limit. I'm going to ride by
myself."</p>
<p>Her pleasure in Selwyn's society had gradually become such
genuine pleasure, her confidence in his kindness so unaffectedly
sincere, that, insensibly, she had fallen into something of his
manner of badinage&mdash;especially since she realised how much
amusement he found in her own smiling confusion when unexpectedly
assailed. Also, to her surprise, she found that he could be plagued
very easily, though she did not quite dare to at first, in view of
his impressive years and experience.</p>
<p>But once goaded to it, she was astonished to find how suddenly
it seemed to readjust their personal relations&mdash;years and
experience falling from his shoulders like a cloak which had
concealed a man very nearly her own age; years and experience
adding themselves to her, and at least an inch to her stature to
redress the balance between them.</p>
<p>It had amused him immensely as he realised the subtle change;
and it pleased him, too, because no man of thirty-five cares to be
treated <i>en grandp&egrave;re</i> by a girl of nineteen, even if
she has not yet worn the polish from her first pair of high-heeled
shoes.</p>
<p>"It's astonishing," he said, "how little respect infirmity and
age command in these days."</p>
<p>"I do respect you," she insisted, "especially your infirmity of
purpose. You said you were going to ride by yourself. But, do you
know, I don't believe you are of a particularly solitary
disposition; are you?"</p>
<p>He laughed at first, then suddenly his face fell.</p>
<p>"Not from choice," he said, under his breath. Her quick ear
heard, and she turned, semi-serious, questioning him with raised
eyebrows.</p>
<p>"Nothing; I was just muttering. I've a villainous habit of
muttering mushy nothings&mdash;"</p>
<p>"You <i>did</i> say something!"</p>
<p>"No; only ghoulish gabble; the mere murky mouthings of a meagre
mind."</p>
<p>"You <i>did</i>. It's rude not to repeat it when I ask you."</p>
<p>"I didn't mean to be rude."</p>
<p>"Then repeat what you said to yourself."</p>
<p>"Do you wish me to?" he asked, raising his eyes so gravely that
the smile faded from lip and voice when she answered: "I beg your
pardon, Captain Selwyn. I did not know you were serious."</p>
<p>"Oh, I'm not," he returned lightly, "I'm never serious. No man
who soliloquises can be taken seriously. Don't you know, Miss
Erroll, that the crowning absurdity of all tragedy is the
soliloquy?"</p>
<p>Her smile became delightfully uncertain; she did not quite
understand him&mdash;though her instinct warned her that, for a
second, something had menaced their understanding.</p>
<p>Riding forward with him through the crisp sunshine of
mid-December, the word "tragedy" still sounding in her ears, her
thoughts reverted naturally to the only tragedy besides her own
which had ever come very near to her&mdash;his own.</p>
<p>Could he have meant <i>that</i>? Did people mention such things
after they had happened? Did they not rather conceal them, hide
them deeper and deeper with the aid of time and the kindly years
for a burial past all recollection?</p>
<p>Troubled, uncomfortably intent on evading every thought or train
of ideas evoked, she put her mount to a gallop. But thought kept
pace with her.</p>
<p>She was, of course, aware of the situation regarding Selwyn's
domestic affairs; she could not very well have been kept long in
ignorance of the facts; so Nina had told her carefully, leaving in
the young girl's mind only a bewildered sympathy for man and wife
whom a dreadful and incomprehensible catastrophe had overtaken;
only an impression of something new and fearsome which she had
hitherto been unaware of in the world, and which was to be added to
her small but, unhappily, growing list of sad and incredible
things.</p>
<p>The finality of the affair, according to Nina, was what had
seemed to her the most distressing&mdash;as though those two were
already dead people. She was unable to understand it. Could no
glimmer of hope remain that, in that magic "some day" of all young
minds, the evil mystery might dissolve? Could there be no living
"happily ever after" in the wake of such a storm? She had managed
to hope for that, and believe in it.</p>
<p>Then, in some way, the news of Alixe's marriage to Ruthven
filtered through the family silence. She had gone straight to Nina,
horrified, unbelieving. And, when the long, tender, intimate
interview was over, another unhappy truth, very gently revealed,
was added to the growing list already learned by this young
girl.</p>
<p>Then Selwyn came. She had already learned something of the
world's customs and manners before his advent; she had learned more
since his advent; and she was learning something else, too&mdash;to
understand how happily ignorant of many matters she had been, had
better be, and had best remain. And she harboured no malsane desire
to know more than was necessary, and every innocent instinct to
preserve her ignorance intact as long as the world permitted.</p>
<p>As for the man riding there at her side, his problem was simple
enough as he summed it up: to face the world, however it might
chance to spin, that small, ridiculous, haphazard world rattling
like a rickety roulette ball among the numbered nights and days
where he had no longer any vital stake at hazard&mdash;no longer
any chance to win or lose.</p>
<p>This was an unstable state of mind, particularly as he had not
yet destroyed the photograph which he kept locked in his despatch
box. He had not returned it, either; it was too late by several
months to do that, but he was still fool enough to consider the
idea at moments&mdash;sometimes after a nursery romp with the
children, or after a good-night kiss from Drina on the lamp-lit
landing, or when some commonplace episode of the domesticity around
him hurt him, cutting him to the quick with its very simplicity, as
when Nina's hand fell naturally into Austin's on their way to "lean
over" the children at bedtime, or their frank absorption in
conjugal discussion to his own exclusion as he sat brooding by the
embers in the library.</p>
<p>"I'm like a dead man at times," he said to himself; "nothing to
expect of a man who is done for; and worst of all, I no longer
expect anything of myself."</p>
<p>This was sufficiently morbid, and he usually proved it by going
early to his own quarters, where dawn sometimes surprised him
asleep in his chair, white and worn, all the youth in his hollow
face extinct, his wife's picture fallen face downward on the
floor.</p>
<p>But he always picked it up again when he awoke, and carefully
dusted it, too, even when half stupefied with sleep.</p>
<hr style='width: 45%;' />
<p>Returning from their gallop, Miss Erroll had very little to say.
Selwyn, too, was silent and absent-minded. The girl glanced
furtively at him from time to time, not at all enlightened. Man,
naturally, was to her an unknown quantity. In fact she had no
reason to suspect him of being anything more intricate than the
platitudinous dance or dinner partner in black and white, or any
frock-coated entity in the afternoon, or any flannelled individual
at the nets or on the links or cantering about the veranda of club,
casino, or cottage, in evident anxiety to be considerate and
agreeable.</p>
<p>This one, however, appeared to have individual peculiarities; he
differed from his brother Caucasians, who should all resemble one
another to any normal girl. For one thing he was subject to
illogical moods&mdash;apparently not caring whether she noticed
them or not. For another, he permitted himself the liberty of long
and unreasonable silences whenever he pleased. This she had
accepted unquestioningly in the early days when she was a little in
awe of him, when the discrepancy of their ages and experiences had
not been dissipated by her first presumptuous laughter at his
expense.</p>
<p>Now it puzzled her, appearing as a specific trait
differentiating him from Man in the abstract.</p>
<p>He had another trick, too, of retiring within himself, even when
smiling at her sallies or banteringly evading her challenge to a
duel of wits. At such times he no longer looked very young; she had
noticed that more than once. He looked old, and ill-tempered.</p>
<p>Perhaps some sorrow&mdash;the actuality being vague in her mind;
perhaps some hidden suffering&mdash;but she learned that he had
never been wounded in battle and had never even had measles.</p>
<p>The sudden sullen pallor, the capricious fits of silent reserve,
the smiling aloofness, she never attributed to the real source. How
could she? The Incomprehensible Thing was a Finality accomplished
according to law. And the woman concerned was now another man's
wife. Which conclusively proved that there could be no regret
arising from the Incomprehensible Finality, and that nobody
involved cared, much less suffered. Hence <i>that</i> was certainly
not the cause of any erratic or specific phenomena exhibited by
this sample of man who differed, as she had noticed, somewhat from
the rank and file of his neutral-tinted brothers.</p>
<p>"It's this particular specimen, <i>per se</i>," she concluded;
"it's himself, <i>sui generis</i>&mdash;just as I happen to have
red hair. That is all."</p>
<p>And she rode on quite happily, content, confident of his
interest and kindness. For she had never forgotten his warm
response to her when she stood on the threshold of her first real
dinner party, in her first real dinner gown&mdash;a trivial
incident, trivial words! But they had meant more to her than any
man specimen could understand&mdash;including the man who had
uttered them; and the violets, which she found later with his card,
must remain for her ever after the delicately fragrant symbol of
all he had done for her in a solitude, the completeness of which
she herself was only vaguely beginning to realise.</p>
<p>Thinking of this now, she thought of her brother&mdash;and the
old hurt at his absence on that night throbbed again. Forgive? Yes.
But how could she forget it?</p>
<p>"I wish you knew Gerald well," she said impulsively; "he is such
a dear fellow; and I think you'd be good for him&mdash;and
besides," she hastened to add, with instinctive loyalty, lest he
misconstrue, "Gerald would be good for you. We were a great deal
together&mdash;at one time."</p>
<p>He nodded, smilingly attentive.</p>
<p>"Of course when he went away to school it was different," she
added. "And then he went to Yale; that was four more years, you
see."</p>
<p>"I was a Yale man," remarked Selwyn; "did he&mdash;" but he
broke off abruptly, for he knew quite well that young Erroll could
have made no senior society without his hearing of it. And he had
not heard of it&mdash;not in the cane-brakes of Leyte where, on his
sweat-soaked shirt, a small pin of heavy gold had clung through
many a hike and many a scout and by many a camp-fire where the talk
was of home and of the chances of crews and of quarter-backs.</p>
<p>"What were you going to ask me, Captain Selwyn?"</p>
<p>"Did he row&mdash;your brother Gerald?"</p>
<p>"No," she said. She did not add that he had broken training;
that was her own sorrow, to be concealed even from Gerald. "No; he
played polo sometimes. He rides beautifully, Captain Selwyn, and he
is so clever when he cares to be&mdash;at the traps, for
example&mdash;and&mdash;oh&mdash;anything. He once swam&mdash;oh,
dear, I forget; was it five or fifteen or fifty miles? Is that
<i>too</i> far? Do people swim those distances?"</p>
<p>"Some of those distances," replied Selwyn.</p>
<p>"Well, then, Gerald swam some of those distances&mdash;and
everybody was amazed. . . . I do wish you knew him well."</p>
<p>"I mean to," he said. "I must look him up at his rooms or his
club or&mdash;perhaps&mdash;at Neergard &amp; Co."</p>
<p>"<i>Will</i> you do this?" she asked, so earnestly that he
glanced up surprised.</p>
<p>"Yes," he said; and after a moment: "I'll do it to-day, I think;
this afternoon."</p>
<p>"Have you time? You mustn't let me&mdash;"</p>
<p>"Time?" he repeated; "I have nothing else, except a watch to
help me get rid of it."</p>
<p>"I'm afraid I help you get rid of it, too. I heard Nina warning
the children to let you alone occasionally&mdash;and I suppose she
meant that for me, too. But I only take your mornings, don't I?
Nina is unreasonable; I never bother you in the afternoons or
evenings; do you know I have not dined at home for nearly a
month&mdash;except when we've asked people?"</p>
<p>"Are you having a good time?" he asked condescendingly, but
without intention.</p>
<p>"Heavenly. How can you ask that?&mdash;with every day filled and
a chance to decline something every day. If you'd only go to
one&mdash;just one of the dances and teas and dinners, you'd be
able to see for yourself what a good time I am having. . . . I
don't know why I should be so delightfully lucky, but everybody
asks me to dance, and every man I meet is particularly nice, and
nobody has been very horrid to me; perhaps because I like
everybody&mdash;"</p>
<p>She rode on beside him; they were walking their horses now; and
as her silken-coated mount paced forward through the sunshine she
sat at ease, straight as a slender Amazon in her habit, ruddy hair
glistening at the nape of her neck, the scarlet of her lips always
a vivid contrast to that wonderful unblemished skin of snow.</p>
<p>He thought to himself, quite impersonally: "She's a real beauty,
that youngster. No wonder they ask her to dance and nobody is
horrid. Men are likely enough to go quite mad about her as Nina
predicts: probably some of 'em have already&mdash;that
chuckle-headed youth who was there Tuesday, gulping up the
tea&mdash;" And, "What was his name?" he asked aloud.</p>
<p>"Whose name?" she inquired, roused by his voice from smiling
retrospection.</p>
<p>"That chuckle head&mdash;the young man who continued to haunt
you so persistently when you poured tea for Nina on Tuesday. Of
course they <i>all</i> haunted you," he explained politely, as she
shook her head in sign of non-comprehension; "but there was one
who&mdash;ah&mdash;gulped at his cup."</p>
<p>"Please&mdash;you are rather dreadful, aren't you?"</p>
<p>"Yes. So was he; I mean the infatuated chinless gentleman whose
facial ensemble remotely resembled the features of a pleased and
placid lizard of the Reptilian period."</p>
<p>"Oh, George Fane! That is particularly disagreeable of you,
Captain Selwyn, because his wife has been very nice to
me&mdash;Rosamund Fane&mdash;and she spoke most cordially of
you&mdash;"</p>
<p>"Which one was she?"</p>
<p>"The Dresden china one. She looks&mdash;she simply cannot look
as though she were married. It's most amusing&mdash;for people
always take her for somebody's youngest sister who will be out next
winter. . . . Don't you remember seeing her?"</p>
<p>"No, I don't. But there were dozens coming and going every
minute whom I didn't know. Still, I behaved well, didn't I?"</p>
<p>"Pretty badly&mdash;to Kathleen Lawn, whom you cornered so that
she couldn't escape until her mother made her go without any
tea."</p>
<p>"Was <i>that</i> the reason that old lady looked at me so
queerly?"</p>
<p>"Probably. I did, too, but you were taking chances, not hints. .
. . She <i>is</i> attractive, isn't she?"</p>
<p>"Very fetching," he said, leaning down to examine his stirrup
leathers which he had already lengthened twice. "I've got to have
Cummins punch these again," he muttered; "or am I growing
queer-legged in my old age?"</p>
<p>As he straightened up, Miss Erroll said: "Here comes Mr. Fane
now&mdash;with a strikingly pretty girl. How beautifully they are
mounted"&mdash;smilingly returning Fane's salute&mdash;"and
she&mdash;oh! so you <i>do</i> know her, Captain Selwyn? Who is
she?"</p>
<p>Crop raised mechanically in dazed salute, Selwyn's light touch
on the bridle had tightened to a nervous clutch which brought his
horse up sharply.</p>
<p>"What is it?" she asked, drawing bridle in her turn and looking
back into his white, stupefied face.</p>
<p>"Pain," he said, unconscious that he spoke. At the same instant
the stunned eyes found their focus&mdash;and found her beside his
stirrup, leaning wide from her seat in sweet concern, one gloved
hand resting on the pommel of his saddle.</p>
<p>"Are you ill?" she asked; "shall we dismount? If you feel dizzy,
please lean against me."</p>
<p>"I am all right," he said coolly; and as she recovered her seat
he set his horse in motion. His face had become very red now; he
looked at her, then beyond her, with all the deliberate
concentration of aloof indifference.</p>
<p>Confused, conscious that something had happened which she did
not comprehend, and sensitively aware of the preoccupation which,
if it did not ignore her, accepted her presence as of no
consequence, she permitted her horse to set his own pace.</p>
<p>Neither self-command nor self-control was lacking now in Selwyn;
he simply was too self-absorbed to care what she
thought&mdash;whether she thought at all. And into his
consciousness, throbbing heavily under the rushing reaction from
shock, crowded the crude fact that Alixe was no longer an
apparition evoked in sleeplessness, in sun-lit brooding; in the
solitude of crowded avenues and swarming streets; she was an actual
presence again in his life&mdash;she was here, bodily,
unchanged&mdash;unchanged!&mdash;for he had conceived a strange
idea that she must have changed physically, that her appearance had
altered. He knew it was a grotesquely senseless idea, but it clung
to him, and he had nursed it unconsciously.</p>
<p>He had, truly enough, expected to encounter her in life
again&mdash;somewhere; though what he had been preparing to see,
Heaven alone knew; but certainly not the supple, laughing girl he
had known&mdash;that smooth, slender, dark-eyed, dainty visitor who
had played at marriage with him through a troubled and unreal
dream; and was gone when he awoke&mdash;so swift the brief two
years had passed, as swift in sorrow as in happiness.</p>
<p>Two vision-tinted years!&mdash;ended as an hour ends with the
muffled chimes of a clock, leaving the air of an empty room
vibrant. Two years!&mdash;a swift, restless dream aglow with exotic
colour, echoing with laughter and bugle-call and the noise of the
surf on Samar rocks&mdash;a dream through which stirred the rustle
of strange brocades and the whisper of breezes blowing over the
grasses of Leyte; and the light, dry report of rifles, and the
shuffle of bare feet in darkened bungalows, and the whisper of dawn
in Manila town.</p>
<p>Two years!&mdash;wherever they came from, wherever they had
gone. And now, out of the ghostly, shadowy memory, behold
<i>her</i> stepping into the world again!&mdash;living, breathing,
quickening with the fire of life undimmed in her. And he had seen
the bright colour spreading to her eyes, and the dark eyes widen to
his stare; he had seen the vivid blush, the forced smile, the nod,
the voiceless parting of her stiffened lips. Then she was gone,
leaving the whole world peopled with her living presence and the
very sky ringing with the words her lips had never uttered, never
would utter while sun and moon and stars endured.</p>
<p>Shrinking from the clamouring tumult of his thoughts he looked
around, hard-eyed and drawn of mouth, to find Miss Erroll riding a
length in advance, her gaze fixed resolutely between her horse's
ears.</p>
<p>How much had she noticed? How much had she divined?&mdash;this
straight, white-throated young girl, with her self-possession and
her rounded, firm young figure, this child with the pure, curved
cheek, the clear, fearless eyes, untainted, ignorant, incredulous
of shame, of evil.</p>
<p>Severe, confident, untroubled in the freshness of adolescence,
she rode on, straight before her, symbolic innocence leading the
disillusioned. And he followed, hard, dry eyes narrowing, ever
narrowing and flinching under the smiling gaze of the dark-eyed,
red-mouthed ghost that sat there on his saddle bow, facing him,
almost in his very arms.</p>
<hr style='width: 45%;' />
<p>Luncheon had not been served when they returned. Without
lingering on the landing as usual, they exchanged a formal word or
two, then Eileen mounted to her own quarters and Selwyn walked
nervously through the library, where he saw Nina evidently prepared
for some mid-day festivity, for she wore hat and furs, and the
brougham was outside.</p>
<p>"Oh, Phil," she said, "Eileen probably forgot that I was going
out; it's a directors' luncheon at the exchange. Please tell Eileen
that I can't wait for her; where is she?"</p>
<p>"Dressing, I suppose. Nina, I&mdash;"</p>
<p>"One moment, dear. I promised the children that you would lunch
with them in the nursery. Do you mind? I did it to keep them quiet;
I was weak enough to compromise between a fox hunt or fudge; so I
said you'd lunch with them.. Will you?"</p>
<p>"Certainly. . . . And, Nina&mdash;what sort of a man is this
George Fane?"</p>
<p>"Fane?"</p>
<p>"Yes&mdash;the chinless gentleman with gentle brown and
protruding eyes and the expression of a tame brontosaurus."</p>
<p>"Why&mdash;how do you mean, Phil? What sort of man? He's a
banker. He isn't very pretty, but he's popular."</p>
<p>"Oh, popular!" he nodded, as close to a sneer as he could ever
get.</p>
<p>"He has a very popular wife, too; haven't you met Rosamund?
People like him; he's about everywhere&mdash;very useful, very
devoted to pretty women; but I'm really in a hurry, Phil. Won't you
please explain to Eileen that I couldn't wait? You and she were
almost an hour late. Now I must pick up my skirts and fly, or
there'll be some indignant dowagers downtown. . . . Good-bye, dear.
. . . And <i>don't</i> let the children eat too fast! Make Drina
take thirty-six chews to every bite; and Winthrop is to have no
bread if he has potatoes&mdash;" Her voice dwindled and died, away
through the hall; the front door clanged.</p>
<p>He went to his quarters, drove out Austin's man, arranged his
own fresh linen, took a sulky plunge; and, an unlighted cigarette
between his teeth, completed his dressing in sullen
introspection.</p>
<p>When he had tied his scarf and bitten his cigarette to pieces,
he paced the room once or twice, squared his shoulders, breathed
deeply, and, unbending his eyebrows, walked off to the nursery.</p>
<p>"Hello, you kids!" he said, with an effort. "I've come to
luncheon. Very nice of you to want me, Drina."</p>
<p>"I wanted you, too!" said Billy; "I'm to sit beside
you&mdash;"</p>
<p>"So am I," observed Drina, pushing Winthrop out of the chair and
sliding in close to Selwyn. She had the cat, Kit-Ki, in her arms.
Kit-Ki, divining nourishment, was purring loudly.</p>
<p>Josephine and Clemence, in pinafores and stickout skirts, sat
wriggling, with Winthrop between them; the five dogs sat in a row
behind; Katie and Bridget assumed the functions of Hibernian Hebes;
and luncheon began with a clatter of spoons.</p>
<p>It being also the children's dinner&mdash;supper and bed
occurring from five to six&mdash;meat figured on the card, and
Kit-Ki's purring increased to an ecstatic and wheezy squeal, and
her rigid tail, as she stood up on Drina's lap, was constantly
brushing Selwyn's features.</p>
<p>"The cat is shedding, too," he remarked, as he dodged her caudal
appendage for the twentieth time; "it will go in with the next
spoonful, Drina, if you're not careful about opening your
mouth."</p>
<p>"I love Kit-Ki," said Drina placidly. "I have written a poem to
her&mdash;where is it?&mdash;hand it to me, Bridget."</p>
<p>And, laying down her fork and crossing her bare legs under the
table, Drina took breath and read rapidly:</p>
<div class='blockquot'>"LINES TO MY CAT<br />
<br />
"Why<br />
Do I love Kit-Ki<br />
And run after<br />
Her with laughter<br />
And rub her fur<br />
So she will purr?<br />
Why do I know<br />
That Kit-Ki loves me so?<br />
I know it if<br />
Her tail stands up stiff<br />
And she beguiles<br />
Me with smiles&mdash;"</div>
<p>"Huh!" said Billy, "cats don't smile!"</p>
<p>"They do. When they look pleasant they smile," said Drina, and
continued reading from her own works:</p>
<div class='blockquot'>"Be kind in all<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">You say and do</span><br />
For God made Kit-Ki<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The same as you.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 3.5em;">"Yours truly,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 4.5em;">"ALEXANDRINA GERARD.</span></div>
<p>She looked doubtfully at Selwyn. "Is it all right to sign a
poem? I believe that poets sign their works, don't they, Uncle
Philip?"</p>
<p>"Certainly. Drina, I'll give you a dollar for that poem."</p>
<p>"You may have it, anyway," said Drina, generously; and, as an
after-thought: "My birthday is next Wednesday."</p>
<p>"What a hint!" jeered Billy, casting a morsel at the dogs.</p>
<p>"It isn't a hint. It had nothing to do with my poem, and I'll
write you several more, Uncle Philip," protested the child,
cuddling against him, spoon in hand, and inadvertently decorating
his sleeve with cranberry sauce.</p>
<p>Cat hairs and cranberry are a great deal for a man to endure,
but he gave Drina a reassuring hug and a whisper, and leaned back
to remove traces of the affectionate encounter just as Miss Erroll
entered.</p>
<p>"Oh, Eileen! Eileen!" cried the children; "are you coming to
luncheon with us?"</p>
<p>As Selwyn rose, she nodded, amused.</p>
<p>"I am rather hurt," she said. "I went down to luncheon, but as
soon as I heard where you all were I marched straight up here to
demand the reason of my ostracism."</p>
<p>"We thought you had gone with mother," explained Drina, looking
about for a chair.</p>
<p>Selwyn brought it. "I was commissioned to say that Nina couldn't
wait&mdash;dowagers and cakes and all that, you know. Won't you sit
down? It's rather messy and the cat is the guest of honour."</p>
<p>"We have three guests of honour," said Drina; "you, Eileen, and
Kit-Ki. Uncle Philip, mother has forbidden me to speak of it, so I
shall tell her and be punished&mdash;but <i>wouldn't</i> it be
splendid if Aunt Alixe were only here with us?"</p>
<p>Selwyn turned sharply, every atom of colour gone; and the child
smiled up at him. "<i>Wouldn't</i> it?" she pleaded.</p>
<p>"Yes," he said, so quietly that something silenced the child.
And Eileen, giving ostentatious and undivided attention to the
dogs, was now enveloped by snooping, eager muzzles and frantically
wagging tails.</p>
<p>"My lap is full of paws!" she exclaimed; "take them away, Katie!
And oh!&mdash;my gown, my gown!&mdash;Billy, stop waving your
tumbler around my face! If you spill that milk on me I shall ask
your Uncle Philip to put you in the guard-house!"</p>
<p>"You're going to bolo us, aren't you, Uncle Philip?" inquired
Billy. "It's my turn to be killed, you remember&mdash;"</p>
<p>"I have an idea," said Selwyn, "that Miss Erroll is going to
play for you to sing."</p>
<p>They liked that. The infant Gerards were musically inclined, and
nothing pleased them better than to lift their voices in unison.
Besides, it always distressed Kit-Ki, and they never tired laughing
to see the unhappy cat retreat before the first minor chord struck
on the piano. More than that, the dogs always protested, noses
pointed heavenward. It meant noise, which was always welcome in any
form.</p>
<p>"Will you play, Miss Erroll?" inquired Selwyn.</p>
<p>Miss Erroll would play.</p>
<p>"Why do you always call her 'Miss Erroll'?" asked Billy. "Why
don't you say 'Eileen'?"</p>
<p>Selwyn laughed. "I don't know, Billy; ask her; perhaps she
knows."</p>
<p>Eileen laughed, too, delicately embarrassed and aware of his
teasing smile. But Drina, always impressed by formality, said:
"Uncle Philip isn't Eileen's uncle. People who are not relations
say <i>Miss and Mrs</i>."</p>
<p>"Are faver and muvver relations?" asked Josephine timidly.</p>
<p>"Y-es&mdash;no!&mdash;I don't know," admitted Drina; "<i>are</i>
they, Eileen?"</p>
<p>"Why, yes&mdash;that is&mdash;that is to say&mdash;" And turning
to Selwyn: "What dreadful questions. <i>Are</i> they relations,
Captain Selwyn? Of course they are!"</p>
<p>"They were not before they were married," he said, laughing.</p>
<p>"If you married Eileen," began Billy, "you'd call her Eileen, I
suppose."</p>
<p>"Certainly," said Selwyn.</p>
<p>"Why don't you?"</p>
<p>"That is another thing you must ask her, my son."</p>
<p>"Well, then, Eileen&mdash;"</p>
<p>But Miss Erroll was already seated at the nursery piano, and his
demands were drowned in a decisive chord which brought the children
clustering around her, while their nurses ran among them untying
bibs and scrubbing faces and fingers in fresh water.</p>
<p>They sang like seraphs, grouped around the piano, fingers linked
behind their backs. First it was "The Vicar of Bray."
Then&mdash;and the cat fled at the first chord&mdash;"Lochleven
Castle":</p>
<div class='blockquot'>"Put off, put off,<br />
And row with speed<br />
For now is the time and the hour of need."</div>
<p>Miss Erroll sang, too; her voice leading&mdash;a charmingly
trained, but childlike voice, of no pretensions, as fresh and
unspoiled as the girl herself.</p>
<p>There was an interval after "Castles in the Air"; Eileen sat,
with her marvellously white hands resting on the keys, awaiting
further suggestion.</p>
<p>"Sing that funny song, Uncle Philip!" pleaded Billy; "you
know&mdash;the one about:</p>
<div class='blockquot'><span style="margin-left: 1em;">"She hit him
with a shingle</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Which made his breeches
tingle</span><br />
Because he pinched his little baby brother;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And he ran down the
lane</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">With his pants full of
pain.</span><br />
Oh, a boy's best friend is his mother!"</div>
<p>"<i>Billy!</i>" gasped Miss Erroll.</p>
<p>Selwyn, mortified, said severely: "That is a very dreadful song,
Billy&mdash;"</p>
<p>"But <i>you</i> taught it to me&mdash;"</p>
<p>Eileen swung around on the piano stool, but Selwyn had seized
Billy and was promising to bolo him as soon as he wished.</p>
<p>And Eileen, surveying the scene from her perch, thought that
Selwyn's years seemed to depend entirely upon his occupation, for
he looked very boyish down there on his knees among the children;
and she had not yet forgotten the sunken pallor of his features in
the Park&mdash;no, nor her own question to him, still unanswered.
For she had asked him who that woman was who had been so direct in
her smiling salute. And he had not yet replied; probably never
would; for she did not expect to ask him again.</p>
<p>Meanwhile the bolo-men were rushing the outposts to the
outposts' intense satisfaction.</p>
<p>"Bang-bang!" repeated Winthrop; "I hit you, Uncle Philip. You
are dead, you know!"</p>
<p>"Yes, but here comes another! Fire!" shouted Billy. "Save the
flag! Hurrah! Pound on the piano, Eileen, and pretend it's
cannon."</p>
<p>Chord after chord reverberated through the big sunny room,
punctuated by all the cavalry music she had picked up from West
Point and her friends in the squadron.</p>
<div class='blockquot'>"We can't get 'em up!<br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">We can't get 'em up!</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">We can't get 'em up</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">In the morning!"</span></div>
<p>she sang, calmly watching the progress of the battle, until
Selwyn disengaged himself from the <i>m&ecirc;l&eacute;e</i> and
sank breathlessly into a chair.</p>
<p>"All over," he said, declining further combat. "Play the
'Star-spangled Banner,' Miss Erroll."</p>
<p>"Boom!" crashed the chord for the sunset gun; then she played
the anthem; Selwyn rose, and the children stood up at salute.</p>
<p>The party was over.</p>
<p>Selwyn and Miss Erroll, strolling together out of the nursery
and down the stairs, fell unconsciously into the amiable exchange
of badinage again; she taunting him with his undignified behaviour,
he retorting in kind.</p>
<p>"Anyway that was a perfectly dreadful verse you taught Billy,"
she concluded.</p>
<p>"Not as dreadful as the chorus," he remarked, wincing.</p>
<p>"You're exactly like a bad small boy, Captain Selwyn; you look
like one now&mdash;so sheepish! I've seen Gerald attempt to avoid
admonition in exactly that fashion."</p>
<p>"How about a jolly brisk walk?" he inquired blandly; "unless
you've something on. I suppose you have."</p>
<p>"Yes, I have; a tea at the Fanes, a function at the Grays. . . .
Do you know Sudbury Gray? It's his mother."</p>
<p>They had strolled into the living room&mdash;a big, square,
sunny place, in golden greens and browns, where a bay-window
overlooked the Park.</p>
<p>Kneeling on the cushions of the deep window seat she flattened
her delicate nose against the glass, peering out through the lace
hangings.</p>
<p>"Everybody and his family are driving," she said over her
shoulder. "The rich and great are cornering the fresh-air supply.
It's interesting, isn't it, merely to sit here and count coteries!
There is Mrs. Vendenning and Gladys Orchil of the Black Fells set;
there is that pretty Mrs. Delmour-Carnes; Newport! Here come some
Cedarhurst people&mdash;the Fleetwoods. It always surprises one to
see them out of the saddle. There is Evelyn Cardwell; she came out
when I did; and there comes Sandon Craig with a very old
lady&mdash;there, in that old-fashioned coach&mdash;oh, it is Mrs.
Jan Van Elten, senior. What a very, very quaint old lady! I have
been presented at court," she added, with a little laugh, "and now
all the law has been fulfilled."</p>
<p>For a while she kneeled there, silently intent on the passing
pageant with all the unconscious curiosity of a child. Presently,
without turning: "They speak of the younger set&mdash;but what is
its limit? So many, so many people! The hunting crowd&mdash;the
silly crowd&mdash;the wealthy sets&mdash;the dreadful yellow
set&mdash;then all those others made out of metals&mdash;copper and
coal and iron and&mdash;" She shrugged her youthful shoulders,
still intent on the passing show.</p>
<p>"Then there are the intellectuals&mdash;the artistic, the
illuminated, the musical sorts. I&mdash;I wish I knew more of them.
They were my father's friends&mdash;some of them." She looked over
her shoulder to see where Selwyn was, and whether he was listening;
smiled at him, and turned, resting one hand on the window seat. "So
many kinds of people," she said, with a shrug.</p>
<p>"Yes," said Selwyn lazily, "there are all kinds of kinds. You
remember that beautiful nature-poem:</p>
<div class='blockquot'>"'The sea-gull<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And the eagul</span><br />
And the dipper-dapper-duck<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And the Jew-fish</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And the blue-fish</span><br />
And the turtle in the muck;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And the squir'l</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And the girl</span><br />
And the flippy floppy bat<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Are differ-ent</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">As gent from gent.</span><br />
So let it go at that!'"</div>
<p>"What hideous nonsense," she laughed, in open encouragement; but
he could recall nothing more&mdash;or pretended he couldn't.</p>
<p>"You asked me," he said, "whether I know Sudbury Gray. I do,
slightly. What about him?" And he waited, remembering Nina's
suggestion as to that wealthy young man's eligibility.</p>
<p>"He's one of the nicest men I know," she replied frankly.</p>
<p>"Yes, but you don't know 'Boots' Lansing."</p>
<p>"The gentleman who was bucked out of his footwear? Is he
attractive?"</p>
<p>"Rather. Shrieks rent the air when 'Boots' left Manila."</p>
<p>"Feminine shrieks?"</p>
<p>"Exclusively. The men were glad enough. He has three months'
leave this winter, so you'll see him soon."</p>
<p>She thanked him mockingly for the promise, watching him from
amused eyes. After a moment she said:</p>
<p>"I ought to arise and go forth with timbrels and with dances;
but, do you know, I am not inclined to revels? There has been a
little&mdash;just a very little bit too much festivity so far. . .
. Not that I don't adore dinners and gossip and dances; not that I
do not love to pervade bright and glittering places. Oh, no.
Only&mdash;I&mdash;"</p>
<p>She looked shyly a moment at Selwyn: "I sometimes feel a curious
desire for other things. I have been feeling it all day."</p>
<p>"What things?"</p>
<p>"I&mdash;don't know&mdash;exactly; substantial things. I'd like
to learn about things. My father was the head of the American
School of Arch&aelig;ology in Crete. My mother was his intellectual
equal, I believe&mdash;"</p>
<p>Her voice had fallen as she spoke. "Do you wonder that physical
pleasure palls a little at times? I inherit something besides a
capacity for dancing."</p>
<p>He nodded, watching her with an interest and curiosity totally
new.</p>
<p>"When I was ten years old I was taken abroad for the winter. I
saw the excavations in Crete for the buried city which father
discovered near Pr&aelig;sos. We lived for a while with Professor
Flanders in the Fayum district; I saw the ruins of Kahun, built
nearly three thousand years before the coming of Christ; I myself
picked up a scarab as old as the ruins! . . . Captain
Selwyn&mdash;I was only a child of ten; I could understand very
little of what I saw and heard, but I have never, never forgotten
the happiness of that winter! . . . And that is why, at times,
pleasures tire me a little; and a little discontent creeps in. It
is ungrateful and ungracious of me to say so, but I did wish so
much to go to college&mdash;to have something to care for&mdash;as
mother cared for father's work. Why, do you know that my mother
accidentally discovered the thirty-seventh sign in the Karian
Signary?"</p>
<p>"No," said Selwyn, "I did not know that." He forbore to add that
he did not know what a Signary resembled or where Karia might
be.</p>
<p>Miss Erroll's elbow was on her knee, her chin resting within her
open palm.</p>
<p>"Do you know about my parents?" she asked. "They were lost in
the <i>Argolis</i> off Cyprus. You have heard. I think they meant
that I should go to college&mdash;as well as Gerald; I don't know.
Perhaps after all it is better for me to do what other young girls
do. Besides, I enjoy it; and my mother did, too, when she was my
age, they say. She was very much gayer than I am; my mother was a
beauty and a brilliant woman. . . . But there were other qualities.
I&mdash;have her letters to father when Gerald and I were very
little; and her letters to us from London. . . . I have missed her
more, this winter, it seems to me, than even in that dreadful
time&mdash;"</p>
<p>She sat silent, chin in hand, delicate fingers restlessly
worrying her red lips; then, in quick impulse:</p>
<p>"You will not mistake me, Captain Selwyn! Nina and Austin have
been perfectly sweet to me and to Gerald."</p>
<p>"I am not mistaking a word you utter," he said.</p>
<p>"No, of course not. . . . Only there are times . . . moments . .
."</p>
<p>Her voice died; her clear eyes looked out into space while the
silent seconds lengthened into minutes. One slender finger had
slipped between her lips and teeth; the burnished strand of hair
which Nina dreaded lay neglected against her cheek.</p>
<p>"I should like to know," she began, as though to herself,
"something about everything. That being out of the question, I
should like to know everything about something. That also being out
of the question, for third choice I should like to know something
about something. I am not too ambitious, am I?"</p>
<p>Selwyn did not offer to answer.</p>
<p>"<i>Am</i> I?" she repeated, looking directly at him.</p>
<p>"I thought you were asking yourself."</p>
<p>"But you need not reply; there is no sense in my question."</p>
<p>She stood up, indifferent, absent-eyed, half turning toward the
window; and, raising her hand, she carelessly brought the rebel
strand of hair under discipline.</p>
<p>"You <i>said</i> you were going to look up Gerald," she
observed.</p>
<p>"I am; now. What are you going to do?"</p>
<p>"I? Oh, dress, I suppose. Nina ought to be back now, and she
expects me to go out with her."</p>
<p>She nodded a smiling termination of their duet, and moved toward
the door. Then, on impulse, she turned, a question on her
lips&mdash;left unuttered through instinct. It had to do with the
identity of the pretty woman who had so directly saluted him in the
Park&mdash;a perfectly friendly, simple, and natural question. Yet
it remained unuttered.</p>
<p>She turned again to the doorway; a maid stood there holding a
note on a salver.</p>
<p>"For Captain Selwyn, please," murmured the maid.</p>
<p>Miss Erroll passed out.</p>
<p>Selwyn took the note and broke the seal:</p>
<div class="blockquot">
<p>"MY DEAR SELWYN: I'm in a beastly fix&mdash;an I.O.U. due
to-night and <i>pas de quoi</i>! Obviously I don't want Neergard to
know, being associated as I am with him in business. As for Austin,
he's a peppery old boy, bless his heart, and I'm not very secure in
his good graces at present. Fact is I got into a rather stiff game
last night&mdash;and it's a matter of honour. So can you help me to
tide it over? I'll square it on the first of the month.</p>
<p>"Yours sincerely,</p>
<p>"GERALD ERROLL.</p>
<p>"P.S.&mdash;I've meant to look you up for ever so long, and will
the first moment I have free."</p>
</div>
<p>Below this was pencilled the amount due; and Selwyn's face grew
very serious.</p>
<p>The letter he wrote in return ran:</p>
<div class="blockquot">
<p>"DEAR GERALD: Check enclosed to your order. By the way, can't
you lunch with me at the Lenox Club some day this week? Write,
wire, or telephone when.</p>
<p>"Yours,</p>
<p>"SELWYN."</p>
</div>
<p>When he had sent the note away by the messenger he walked back
to the bay-window, hands in his pockets, a worried expression in
his gray eyes. This sort of thing must not be repeated; the boy
must halt in his tracks and face sharply the other way. Besides,
his own income was limited&mdash;much too limited to admit of many
more loans of that sort.</p>
<p>He ought to see Gerald at once, but somehow he could not in
decency appear personally on the heels of his loan. A certain
interval must elapse between the loan and the lecture; in fact he
didn't see very well how he could admonish and instruct until the
loan had been cancelled&mdash;that is, until the first of the New
Year.</p>
<p>Pacing the floor, disturbed, uncertain as to the course he
should pursue, he looked up presently to see Miss Erroll descending
the stairs, fresh and sweet in her radiant plumage. As she caught
his eye she waved a silvery chinchilla muff at him&mdash;a marching
salute&mdash;and passed on, calling back to him: "Don't forget
Gerald!"</p>
<p>"No," he said, "I won't forget Gerald." He stood a moment at the
window watching the brougham below where Nina awaited Miss Erroll.
Then, abruptly, he turned back into the room and picked up the
telephone receiver, muttering: "This is no time to mince matters
for the sake of appearances." And he called up Gerald at the
offices of Neergard &amp; Co.</p>
<p>"Is it you, Gerald?" he asked pleasantly. "It's all right about
that matter; I've sent you a note by your messenger. But I want to
talk to you about another matter&mdash;something concerning
myself&mdash;I want to ask your advice, in a way. Can you be at the
Lenox by six? . . . You have an engagement at eight? Oh, that's all
right; I won't keep you. . . . It's understood, then; the Lenox at
six. . . . Good-bye."</p>
<p>There was the usual early evening influx of men at the Lenox who
dropped in for a glance at the ticker, or for a cocktail or a game
of billiards or a bit of gossip before going home to dress.</p>
<p>Selwyn sauntered over to the basket, inspected a yard or two of
tape, then strolled toward the window, nodding to Bradley Harmon
and Sandon Craig.</p>
<p>As he turned his face to the window and his back to the room,
Harmon came up rather effusively, offering an unusually thin flat
hand and further hospitality, pleasantly declined by Selwyn.</p>
<p>"Horrible thing, a cocktail," observed Harmon, after giving his
own order and seating himself opposite Selwyn. "I don't usually do
it. Here comes the man who persuades me!&mdash;my own
partner&mdash;"</p>
<p>Selwyn looked up to see Fane approaching; and instantly a dark
flush overspread his face.</p>
<p>"You know George Fane, don't you?" continued Harmon easily;
"well, that's odd; I thought, of course&mdash;Captain Selwyn, Mr.
Fane. It's not usual&mdash;but it's done."</p>
<p>They exchanged formalities&mdash;dry and brief on Selwyn's part,
gracefully urbane on Fane's.</p>
<p>"I've heard so pleasantly of you from Gerald Erroll," he said,
"and of course our people have always been on cordial terms.
Neither Mrs. Fane nor I was fortunate enough to meet you last
Tuesday at the Gerards&mdash;such a crush, you know. Are you not
joining us, Captain Selwyn?" as the servant appeared to take
orders.</p>
<p>Selwyn declined again, glancing at Harmon&mdash;a large-framed,
bony young man with blond, closely trimmed and pointed beard, and
the fair colour of a Swede. He had the high, flat cheek-bones of
one, too; and a thicket of corn-tinted hair, which was usually damp
at the ends, and curled flat against his forehead. He seemed to be
always in a slight perspiration&mdash;he had been, anyway, every
time Selwyn met him anywhere.</p>
<p>Sandon Craig and Billy Fleetwood came wandering up and joined
them; one or two other men, drifting by, adhered to the group.</p>
<p>Selwyn, involved in small talk, glanced sideways at the great
clock, and gathered himself together for departure.</p>
<p>Fleetwood was saying to Craig: "Certainly it was a stiff
game&mdash;Bradley, myself, Gerald Erroll, Mrs. Delmour-Carnes, and
the Ruthvens."</p>
<p>"Were you hit?" asked Craig, interested.</p>
<p>"No; about even. Gerald got it good and plenty, though. The
Ruthvens were ahead as usual&mdash;"</p>
<p>Selwyn, apparently hearing nothing, quietly rose and stepped out
of the circle, paused to set fire to a cigarette, and then strolled
off toward the visitors' room, where Gerald was now due.</p>
<p>Fane stretched his neck, looking curiously after him. Then he
said to Fleetwood: "Why begin to talk about Mrs. Ruthven when our
friend yonder is about? Rotten judgment you show, Billy."</p>
<p>"Well, I clean forgot," said Fleetwood; "what did I say, anyway?
A man can't always remember who's divorced from who in this
town."</p>
<p>Harmon, whose civility to Selwyn had possibly been based on his
desire for pleasant relations with Austin Gerard and the Arickaree
Loan and Trust Company, looked at Fleetwood thoroughly vexed. But
nobody could have suspected vexation in that high-boned smile which
showed such very red lips through the blond beard.</p>
<p>Fane, too, smiled; his prominent soft brown eyes expressed
gentlest good-humour, and he passed his hand reflectively over his
unusually small and retreating chin. Perhaps he was thinking of the
meeting in the Park that morning. It was amusing; but men do not
speak of such things at their clubs, no matter how amusing.
Besides, if the story were aired and were traced to him, Ruthven
might turn ugly. There was no counting on Ruthven.</p>
<p>Meanwhile Selwyn, perplexed and worried, found young Erroll just
entering the visitors' room, and greeted him with nervous
cordiality.</p>
<p>"If you can't stay and dine with me," he said, "I won't put you
down. You know, of course, I can only ask you once in a year, so
we'll stay here and chat a bit."</p>
<p>"Right you are," said young Erroll, flinging off his very new
and very fashionable overcoat&mdash;a wonderfully handsome boy,
with all the attraction that a quick, warm, impulsive manner
carries. "And I say, Selwyn, it was awfully decent of you
to&mdash;"</p>
<p>"Bosh! Friends are for that sort of thing, Gerald. Sit
here&mdash;" He looked at the young man hesitatingly; but Gerald
calmly took the matter out of his jurisdiction by nodding his order
to the club attendant.</p>
<p>"Lord, but I'm tired," he said, sinking back into a big
arm-chair; "I was up till daylight, and then I had to be in the
office by nine, and to-night Billy Fleetwood is giving&mdash;oh,
something or other. By the way, the market isn't doing a thing to
the shorts! You're not in, are you, Selwyn?"</p>
<p>"No, not that way. I hope you are not, either; are you,
Gerald?"</p>
<p>"Oh, it's all right," replied the young fellow confidently; and
raising his glass, he nodded at Selwyn with a smile.</p>
<p>"You were mighty nice to me, anyhow," he said, setting his glass
aside and lighting a cigar. "You see, I went to a dance, and after
a while some of us cleared out, and Jack Ruthven offered us
trouble; so half a dozen of us went there. I had the worst cards a
man ever drew to a kicker. That was all about it."</p>
<p>The boy was utterly unconscious that he was treading on delicate
ground as he rattled on in his warmhearted, frank, and generous
way. Totally oblivious that the very name of Ruthven must be
unwelcome if not offensive to his listener, he laughed through a
description of the affair, its thrilling episodes, and Mrs. Jack
Ruthven's blind luck in the draw.</p>
<p>"One moment," interrupted Selwyn, very gently; "do you mind
saying whether you banked my check and drew against it?"</p>
<p>"Why, no; I just endorsed it over."</p>
<p>"To&mdash;to whom?&mdash;if I may venture&mdash;"</p>
<p>"Certainly," he said, with a laugh; "to Mrs. Jack&mdash;" Then,
in a flash, for the first time the boy realised what he was saying,
and stopped aghast, scarlet to his hair.</p>
<p>Selwyn's face had little colour remaining in it, but he said
very kindly: "It's all right, Gerald; don't worry&mdash;"</p>
<p>"I'm a beast!" broke out the boy; "I beg your pardon a thousand
times."</p>
<p>"Granted, old chap. But, Gerald, may I say one thing&mdash;or
perhaps two?"</p>
<p>"Go ahead! Give it to me good and plenty!"</p>
<p>"It's only this: couldn't you and I see one another a little
oftener? Don't be afraid of me; I'm no wet blanket. I'm not so very
aged, either; I know something of the world&mdash;I understand
something of men. I'm pretty good company, Gerald. What do you
say?"</p>
<p>"I say, <i>sure</i>!" cried the boy warmly.</p>
<p>"It's a go, then. And one thing more: couldn't you manage to
come up to the house a little oftener? Everybody misses you, of
course; I think your sister is a trifle sensitive&mdash;"</p>
<p>"I will!" said Gerald, blushing. "Somehow I've had such a lot on
hand&mdash;all day at the office, and something on every evening. I
know perfectly well I've neglected Eily&mdash;and everybody. But
the first moment I can find free&mdash;"</p>
<p>Selwyn nodded. "And last of all," he said, "there's something
about my own affairs that I thought you might advise me on."</p>
<p>Gerald, proud, enchanted, stood very straight; the older man
continued gravely:</p>
<p>"I've a little capital to invest&mdash;not very much.
Suppose&mdash;and this, I need not add, is in confidence between
us&mdash;suppose I suggested to Mr. Neergard&mdash;"</p>
<p>"Oh," cried young Erroll, delighted, "that is fine! Neergard
would be glad enough. Why, we've got that Valleydale tract in shape
now, and there are scores of schemes in the air&mdash;scores of
them&mdash;important moves which may mean&mdash;anything!" he
ended, excitedly.</p>
<p>"Then you think it would be all right&mdash;in case Neergard
likes the idea?"</p>
<p>Gerald was enthusiastic. After a while they shook hands, it
being time to separate. And for a long time Selwyn sat there alone
in the visitors' room, absent-eyed, facing the blazing fire of
cannel coal.</p>
<p>How to be friends with this boy without openly playing the
mentor; how to gain his confidence without appearing to seek it;
how to influence him without alarming him! No; there was no great
harm in him yet; only the impulse of inconsiderate youth; only an
enthusiastic capacity for pleasure.</p>
<p>One thing was imperative&mdash;the boy must cut out his
card-playing for stakes at once; and there was a way to accomplish
that by impressing Gerald with the idea that to do anything behind
Neergard's back which he would not care to tell him about was a
sort of treachery.</p>
<p>Who were these people, anyway, who would permit a boy of that
age, and in a responsible position, to play for such stakes? Who
were they to encourage such&mdash;?</p>
<p>Selwyn's tightening grasp on his chair suddenly relaxed; he sank
back, staring at the brilliant coals. He, too, had forgotten.</p>
<p>Now he remembered, in humiliation unspeakable, in bitterness
past all belief.</p>
<p>Time sped, and he sat there, motionless; and gradually the
bitterness became less perceptible as he drifted, intent on
drifting, back through the exotic sorcery of dead years&mdash;back
into the sun again, where honour was bright and life was
young&mdash;where all the world awaited happy conquest&mdash;where
there was no curfew in the red evening glow; no end to day, because
the golden light had turned to silver; but where the earliest hint
of dawn was a challenge, and where every yellow star whispered
"Awake!"</p>
<p>And out of the magic <i>she</i> had come into his world
again!</p>
<p>Sooner or later he would meet her now. That was sure. When?
Where? And of what significance was it, after all?</p>
<p>Whom did it concern? Him? Her? And what had he to say to her,
after all? Or she to him?</p>
<p>Not one word.</p>
<hr style='width: 45%;' />
<p>About midnight he roused himself and picked up his hat and
coat.</p>
<p>"Do you wish a cab, please?" whispered the club servant who held
his coat; "it is snowing very hard, sir."</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_III" id="CHAPTER_III"></a>CHAPTER III</h2>
<h3>UNDER THE ASHES</h3>
<p>He had neither burned nor returned the photograph to Mrs.
Ruthven. The prospect perplexed and depressed Selwyn.</p>
<p>He was sullenly aware that in a town where the divorced must
ever be reckoned with when dance and dinner lists are made out,
there is always some thoughtless hostess&mdash;and sometimes a
mischievous one; and the chances were that he and Mrs. Jack Ruthven
would collide, either through the forgetfulness or malice of
somebody or, through sheer hazard, at some large affair where
Destiny and Fate work busily together in criminal
copartnership.</p>
<p>And he encountered her first at a masque and revel given by Mrs.
Delmour-Carnes where Fate contrived that he should dance in the
same set with his <i>ci-devant</i> wife before the unmasking, and
where, unaware, they gaily exchanged salute and hand-clasp before
the jolly <i>m&ecirc;l&eacute;e</i> of unmasking revealed how close
together two people could come after parting for ever and a night
at the uttermost ends of the earth.</p>
<p>When masks at last were off there was neither necessity nor
occasion for the two surprised and rather pallid young people to
renew civilities; but later, Destiny, the saturnine partner in the
business, interfered; and some fool in the smoking room tried to
introduce Selwyn to Ruthven. The slightest mistake on their parts
would have rendered the incident ridiculous; and Ruthven made that
mistake.</p>
<p>That was Selwyn's first encounter with the Ruthvens. A short
time afterward at the opera Gerald dragged him into a parterre to
say something amiable to one of the d&eacute;butante Craig
girls&mdash;and Selwyn found himself again facing Alixe.</p>
<p>If there was any awkwardness it was not apparent, although they
both knew that they were in full view of the house.</p>
<p>A cool bow and its cooler acknowledgment, a formal word and more
formal reply; and Selwyn made his way to the corridor, hot with
vexation, unaware of where he was going, and oblivious of the
distressed and apologetic young man, who so contritely kept step
with him through the brilliantly crowded promenade.</p>
<p>That was the second time&mdash;not counting distant glimpses in
crowded avenues, in the Park, at Sherry's, or across the hazy
glitter of thronged theatres. But the third encounter was
different.</p>
<p>It was all a mistake, born of the haste of a heedless and
elderly matron, celebrated for managing to do the wrong thing, but
who had been excessively nice to him that winter, and whose
position in Manhattan was not to be assailed.</p>
<p>"Dear Captain Selwyn," she wheezed over the telephone, "I'm
short one man; and we dine at eight and it's that now. <i>Could</i>
you help me? It's the rich and yellow, this time, but you won't
mind, will you?"</p>
<p>Selwyn, standing at the lower telephone in the hall, asked her
to hold the wire a moment, and glanced up at his sister who was
descending the stairs with Eileen, dinner having at that instant
been announced.</p>
<p>"Mrs. T. West Minster&mdash;flying signals of distress," he
said, carefully covering the transmitter as he spoke; "man
overboard, and will I kindly take a turn at the wheel?"</p>
<p>"What a shame!" said Eileen; "you are going to spoil the first
home dinner we have had together in weeks!"</p>
<p>"Tell her to get some yellow pup!" growled Austin, from
above.</p>
<p>"As though anybody could get a yellow pup when they whistle,"
said Nina hopelessly.</p>
<p>"That's true," nodded Selwyn; "I'm the original old dog Tray.
Whistle, and I come padding up. Ever faithful, you see."</p>
<p>And he uncovered the transmitter and explained to Mrs. T. West
Minster his absurd delight at being whistled at. Then he sent for a
cab and sauntered into the dining-room, where he was received with
undisguised hostility.</p>
<p>"She's been civil to me," he said; "<i>jeunesse oblige</i>, you
know. And that's why I&mdash;"</p>
<p>"There'll be a lot of d&eacute;butantes there! What do you want
to go for, you cradle robber!" protested Austin&mdash;"a lot of
water-bibbing, olive-eating, talcum-powdered
d&eacute;butantes&mdash;"</p>
<p>Eileen straightened up stiffly, and Selwyn's teasing smile and
his offered hand in adieu completed her indignation.</p>
<p>"Oh, good-bye! No, I won't shake hands. There's your cab, now. I
wish you'd take Austin, too; Nina and I are tired of dining with
the prematurely aged."</p>
<p>"Indeed, we are," said Mrs. Gerard; "go to your club, Austin,
and give me a chance to telephone to somebody under the anesthetic
age."</p>
<p>Selwyn departed, laughing, but he yawned in his cab all the way
to Fifty-third Street, where he entered in the wake of the usual
laggards and, surrendering hat and coat in the cloak room, picked
up the small slim envelope bearing his name.</p>
<p>The card within disclosed the information that he was to take in
Mrs. Somebody-or-Other; he made his way through a great many
people, found his hostess, backed off, stood on one leg for a
moment like a reflective water-fowl, then found Mrs.
Somebody-or-Other and was absently good to her through a great deal
of noise and some Spanish music, which seemed to squirt through a
thicket of palms and bespatter everybody.</p>
<p>"Wonderful music," observed his dinner partner, with singular
originality; "<i>so</i> like Carmen."</p>
<p>"Is it?" he replied, and took her away at a nod from his
hostess, whose daughter Dorothy leaned forward from her partner's
arm at the same moment, and whispered: "I <i>must</i> speak to you,
mamma! You <i>can't</i> put Captain Selwyn there
because&mdash;"</p>
<p>But her mother was deaf and smilingly sensitive about it, so she
merely guessed what reply her child expected: "It's all settled,
dear; Captain Selwyn arrived a moment ago." And she closed the
file.</p>
<p>It was already too late, anyhow; and presently, turning to see
who was seated on his left, Selwyn found himself gazing into the
calm, flushed face of Alixe Ruthven. It was their third
encounter.</p>
<p>They exchanged a dazed nod of recognition, a meaningless murmur,
and turned again, apparently undisturbed, to their respective
dinner partners.</p>
<p>A great many curious eyes, lingering on them, shifted elsewhere,
in reluctant disappointment.</p>
<p>As for the hostess, she had, for one instant, come as near to
passing heavenward as she could without doing it when she
discovered the situation. Then she accepted it with true humour.
She could afford to. But her daughters, Sheila and Dorothy,
suffered acutely, being of this year's output and martyrs to
responsibility.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Selwyn, grimly aware of an accident somewhere, and
perfectly conscious of the feelings which must by this time
dominate his hostess, was wondering how best to avoid anything that
might resemble a situation.</p>
<p>Instead of two or three dozen small tables, scattered among the
palms of the winter garden, their hostess had preferred to
construct a great oval board around the aquarium. The arrangement
made it a little easier for Selwyn and Mrs. Ruthven. He talked to
his dinner partner until she began to respond in monosyllables,
which closed each subject that he opened and wearied him as much as
he was boring her. But Bradley Harmon, the man on her right,
evidently had better fortune; and presently Selwyn found himself
with nobody to talk to, which came as near to embarrassing him as
anything could, and which so enraged his hostess that she struck
his partner's name from her lists for ever. People were already
glancing at him askance in sly amusement or cold curiosity.</p>
<p>Then he did a thing which endeared him to Mrs. T. West Minster
and to her two disconsolate children.</p>
<p>"Mrs. Ruthven," he said, very naturally and pleasantly, "I think
perhaps we had better talk for a moment or two&mdash;if you don't
mind."</p>
<p>She said quietly, "I don't mind," and turned with charming
composure. Every eye shifted to them, then obeyed decency or
training; and the slightest break in the gay tumult was closed up
with chatter and laughter.</p>
<p>"Plucky," said Sandon Craig to his fair neighbour; "but by what
chance did our unfortunate hostess do it?"</p>
<p>"She's usually doing it, isn't she? What occupies me," returned
his partner, "is how on earth Alixe could have thrown away that
adorable man for Jack Ruthven. Why, he is already trying to
scramble into Rosamund Fane's lap&mdash;the horrid little
poodle!&mdash;always curled up on the edge of your skirt!"</p>
<p>She stared at Mrs. Ruthven across the crystal reservoir brimming
with rose and ivory-tinted water-lilies.</p>
<p>"That girl is marked for destruction," she said slowly; "the
gods have done their work already."</p>
<p>But whatever Alixe had been, whatever she now was, she showed to
her little world only a pale brunette symmetry&mdash;a strange and
changeless lustre, varying as little as the moon's phases; and like
that burnt-out planet, reflecting any flame that flared until her
clear, young beauty seemed pulsating with the promise of hidden
fire.</p>
<p>Selwyn, outwardly amiable and formal, was saying in a low voice:
"My dinner partner is quite impossible, you see; and I happen to be
here as a filler in&mdash;commanded to the presence only a few
minutes ago. It's a pardonable error; I bear no malice. But I'm
sorry for you."</p>
<p>There was a silence; Alixe straightened her slim figure, and
turned; but young Innis, who had taken her in, had become
confidential with Mrs. Fane. As for Selwyn's partner, she probably
divined his conversational designs on her, but she merely turned
her bare shoulder a trifle more unmistakably and continued her
gossip with Bradley Harmon.</p>
<p>Alixe broke a tiny morsel from her bread, sensible of the
tension.</p>
<p>"I suppose," she said, as though reciting to some new
acquaintance an amusing bit of gossip&mdash;"that we are destined
to this sort of thing occasionally and had better get used to
it."</p>
<p>"I suppose so."</p>
<p>"Please," she added, after a pause, "aid me a little."</p>
<p>"I will if I can. What am I to say?"</p>
<p>"Have you nothing to say?" she asked, smiling; "it need not be
very civil, you know&mdash;as long as nobody hears you."</p>
<p>To school his features for the deception of others, to school
his voice and manner and at the same time look smilingly into the
grave of his youth and hope called for the sort of self-command
foreign to his character. Glancing at him under her smoothly fitted
mask of amiability, she slowly grew afraid of the
situation&mdash;but not of her ability to sustain her own part.</p>
<p>They exchanged a few meaningless phrases, then she resolutely
took young Innis away from Rosamund Fane, leaving Selwyn to count
the bubbles in his wine-glass.</p>
<p>But in a few moments, whether by accident or deliberate design,
Rosamund interfered again, and Mrs. Ruthven was confronted with the
choice of a squabble for possession of young Innis, of conspicuous
silence, or of resuming once more with Selwyn. And she chose the
last resort.</p>
<p>"You are living in town?" she asked pleasantly.</p>
<p>"Yes."</p>
<p>"Of course; I forgot. I met a man last night who said you had
entered the firm of Neergard &amp; Co."</p>
<p>"I have. Who was the man?"</p>
<p>"You can never guess, Captain Selwyn."</p>
<p>"I don't want to. Who was he?"</p>
<p>"Please don't terminate so abruptly the few subjects we have in
reserve. We may be obliged to talk to each other for a number of
minutes if Rosamund doesn't let us alone. . . . The man was 'Boots'
Lansing."</p>
<p>"'Boots!' Here!"</p>
<p>"Arrived from Manila Sunday. <i>Sans g&ecirc;ne</i> as usual he
introduced you as the subject, and told me&mdash;oh, dozens of
things about you. I suppose he began inquiring for you before he
crossed the troopers' gangplank; and somebody sent him to Neergard
&amp; Co. Haven't you seen him?"</p>
<p>"No," he said, staring at the brilliant fish, which glided along
the crystal tank, goggling their eyes at the lights.</p>
<p>"You&mdash;you are living with the Gerards, I believe," she said
carelessly.</p>
<p>"For a while."</p>
<p>"Oh, 'Boots' says that he is expecting to take an apartment with
you somewhere."</p>
<p>"What! Has 'Boots' resigned?"</p>
<p>"So he says. He told me that you had resigned. I did not
understand that; I imagined you were here on leave until I heard
about Neergard &amp; Co."</p>
<p>"Do you suppose I could have remained in the service?" he
demanded. His voice was dry and almost accentless.</p>
<p>"Why not?" she returned, paling.</p>
<p>"You may answer that question more pleasantly than I can."</p>
<p>She usually avoided champagne; but she had to do something for
herself now. As for him, he took what was offered without noticing
what he took, and grew whiter and whiter; but a fixed glow
gradually appeared and remained on her cheeks; courage, impatience,
a sudden anger at the forced conditions steadied her nerves.</p>
<p>"Will you please prove equal to the situation?" she said under
her breath, but with a charming smile. "Do you know you are
scowling? These people here are ready to laugh; and I'd much prefer
that they tear us to rags on suspicion of our
over-friendliness."</p>
<p>"Who is that fool woman who is monopolising your partner?"</p>
<p>"Rosamund Fane; she's doing it on purpose. You must try to smile
now and then."</p>
<p>"My face is stiff with grinning," he said, "but I'll do what I
can for you&mdash;"</p>
<p>"Please include yourself, too."</p>
<p>"Oh, I can stand their opinions," he said; "I only meet the
yellow sort occasionally; I don't herd with them."</p>
<p>"I do, thank you."</p>
<p>"How do you like them? What is your opinion of the yellow set?
Here they sit all about you&mdash;the Phoenix Mottlys, Mrs.
Delmour-Carnes yonder, the Draymores, the Orchils, the Vendenning
lady, the Lawns of Westlawn&mdash;" he paused, then
deliberately&mdash;"and the 'Jack' Ruthvens. I forgot, Alixe, that
you are now perfectly equipped to carry aloft the golden hod."</p>
<p>"Go on," she said, drawing a deep breath, but the fixed smile
never altered.</p>
<p>"No," he said; "I can't talk. I thought I could, but I can't.
Take that boy away from Mrs. Fane as soon as you can."</p>
<p>"I can't yet. You must go on. I ask your aid to carry this thing
through. I&mdash;I am afraid of their ridicule. Could you try to
help me a little?"</p>
<p>"If you put it that way, of course." And, after a silence, "What
am I to say? What in God's name shall I say to you, Alixe?"</p>
<p>"Anything bitter&mdash;as long as you control your voice and
features. Try to smile at me when you speak, Philip."</p>
<p>"All right. I have no reason to be bitter, anyway," he said;
"and every reason to be otherwise."</p>
<p>"That is not true. You tell me that I have ruined your career in
the army. I did not know I was doing it. Can you believe me?"</p>
<p>And, as he made no response: "I did not dream you would have to
resign. Do you believe me?"</p>
<p>"There is no choice," he said coldly. "Drop the subject!"</p>
<p>"That is brutal. I never thought&mdash;" She forced a smile and
drew her glass toward her. The straw-tinted wine slopped over and
frothed on the white skin of her arm.</p>
<p>"Well," she breathed, "this ghastly dinner is nearly ended."</p>
<p>He nodded pleasantly.</p>
<p>"And&mdash;Phil?"&mdash;a bit tremulous.</p>
<p>"What?"</p>
<p>"Was it all my fault? I mean in the beginning? I've wanted to
ask you that&mdash;to know your view of it. Was it?"</p>
<p>"No. It was mine, most of it."</p>
<p>"Not all&mdash;not half! We did not know how; that is the
wretched explanation of it all."</p>
<p>"And we could never have learned; that's the rest of the answer.
But the fault is not there."</p>
<p>"I know; 'better to bear the ills we have.'"</p>
<p>"Yes; more respectable to bear them. Let us drop this in
decency's name, Alixe!"</p>
<p>After a silence, she began: "One more thing&mdash;I must know
it; and I am going to ask you&mdash;if I may. Shall I?"</p>
<p>He smiled cordially, and she laughed as though confiding a
delightful bit of news to him:</p>
<p>"Do you regard me as sufficiently important to dislike me?"</p>
<p>"I do not&mdash;dislike you."</p>
<p>"Is it stronger than dislike, Phil?"</p>
<p>"Y-es."</p>
<p>"Contempt?"</p>
<p>"No."</p>
<p>"What is it?"</p>
<p>"It is that&mdash;I have not
yet&mdash;become&mdash;reconciled."</p>
<p>"To my&mdash;folly?"</p>
<p>"To mine."</p>
<p>She strove to laugh lightly, and failing, raised her glass to
her lips again.</p>
<p>"Now you know," he said, pitching his tones still lower. "I am
glad after all that we have had this plain understanding. I have
never felt unkindly toward you. I can't. What you did I might have
prevented had I known enough; but I cannot help it now; nor can you
if you would."</p>
<p>"If I would," she repeated gaily&mdash;for the people opposite
were staring.</p>
<p>"We are done for," he said, nodding carelessly to a servant to
refill his glass; "and I abide by conditions because I choose to;
not," he added contemptuously, "because a complacent law has
tethered you to&mdash;to the thing that has crawled up on your
knees to have its ears rubbed."</p>
<p>The level insult to her husband stunned her; she sat there,
upright, the white smile stamped on her stiffened lips, fingers
tightening about the stem of her wine-glass.</p>
<p>He began to toss bread crumbs to the scarlet fish, laughing to
himself in an ugly way. "<i>I</i> wish to punish you? Why, Alixe,
only look at <i>him</i>!&mdash;Look at his gold wristlets; listen
to his simper, his lisp. Little girl&mdash;oh, little girl, what
have you done to yourself?&mdash;for you have done nothing to me,
child, that can match it in sheer atrocity!"</p>
<p>Her colour was long in returning.</p>
<p>"Philip," she said unsteadily, "I don't think I can stand
this&mdash;"</p>
<p>"Yes, you can."</p>
<p>"I am too close to the wall. I&mdash;"</p>
<p>"Talk to Scott Innis. Take him away from Rosamund Fane; that
will tide you over. Or feed those fool fish; like this! Look how
they rush and flap and spatter! That's amusing, isn't it&mdash;for
people with the intellects of canaries. . . . Will you please try
to say something? Mrs. T. West is exhibiting the restless symptoms
of a hen turkey at sundown and we'll all go to roost in another
minute. . . . Don't shiver that way!"</p>
<p>"I c-can't control it; I will in a moment. . . . Give me a
chance; talk to me, Phil."</p>
<p>"Certainly. The season has been unusually gay and the opera most
stupidly brilliant; stocks continue to fluctuate; another old woman
was tossed and gored by a mad motor this morning. . . . More time,
Alixe? . . . With pleasure; Mrs. Vendenning has bought a third-rate
castle in Wales; a man was found dead with a copy of the
<i>Tribune</i> in his pocket&mdash;the verdict being in accordance
with fact; the Panama Canal&mdash;"</p>
<p>But it was over at last; a flurry of sweeping skirts; ranks of
black and white in escort to the passage of the fluttering silken
procession.</p>
<p>"Good-bye," she said; "I am not staying for the dance."</p>
<p>"Good-bye," he said pleasantly; "I wish you better fortune for
the future. I'm sorry I was rough."</p>
<p>He was not staying, either. A dull excitement possessed him,
resembling suspense&mdash;as though he were awaiting a
d&eacute;nouement; as though there was yet some crisis to come.</p>
<p>Several men leaned forward to talk to him; he heard without
heeding, replied at hazard, lighted his cigar with the others, and
leaned back, his coffee before him&mdash;a smiling, attractive
young fellow, apparently in lazy enjoyment of the time and place
and without one care in the world he found so pleasant.</p>
<p>For a while his mind seemed to be absolutely blank; voices were
voices only; he saw lights, and figures moving through a void. Then
reality took shape sharply; and his pulses began again hammering
out the irregular measure of suspense, though what it was that he
was awaiting, what expecting, Heaven alone knew.</p>
<p>And after a while he found himself in the ballroom.</p>
<p>The younger set was arriving; he recognised several youthful
people, friends of Eileen Erroll; and taking his bearings among
these bright, fresh faces&mdash;amid this animated throng,
constantly increased by the arrival of others, he started to find
his hostess, now lost to sight in the breezy circle of silk and
lace setting in from the stairs.</p>
<p>He heard names announced which meant nothing to him, which
stirred no memory; names which sounded vaguely familiar; names
which caused him to turn quickly&mdash;but seldom were the faces as
familiar as the names.</p>
<p>He said to a girl, behind whose chair he was standing: "All the
younger brothers and sisters are coming here to confound me; I hear
a Miss Innis announced, but it turns out to be her younger
sister&mdash;"</p>
<p>"By the way, do you know my name?" she asked.</p>
<p>"No," he said frankly, "do you know mine?"</p>
<p>"Of course, I do; I listened breathlessly when somebody
presented you wholesale at your sister's the other day. I'm
Rosamund Fane. You might as well be instructed because you're to
take me in at the Orchils' next Thursday night, I believe."</p>
<p>"Rosamund Fane," he repeated coolly. "I wonder how we've avoided
each other so consistently this winter? I never before had a good
view of you, though I heard you talking to young Innis at dinner.
And yet," he added, smiling, "if I had been instructed to look
around and select somebody named Rosamund, I certainly should have
decided on you."</p>
<p>"A compliment?" she asked, raising her delicate eyebrows.</p>
<p>"Ask yourself," he said.</p>
<p>"I do; and I get snubbed."</p>
<p>And, smiling still, he said: "Do you know the most mischievous
air that Schubert ever worried us with?"</p>
<p>"'Rosamund,'" she said; "and&mdash;thank you, Captain Selwyn."
She had coloured to the hair.</p>
<p>"'Rosamund,'" he nodded carelessly&mdash;"the most mischievous
of melodies&mdash;" He stopped short, then coolly resumed: "That
mischievous quality is largely a matter of accident, I fancy.
Schubert never meant that 'Rosamund' should interfere with
anybody's business."</p>
<p>"And&mdash;when did you first encounter the malice in
'Rosamund,' Captain Selwyn?" she asked with perfect
self-possession.</p>
<p>He did not answer immediately; his smile had died out. Then:
"The first time I really understood 'Rosamund' was when I heard
Rosamund during a very delightful dinner."</p>
<p>She said: "If a woman keeps at a man long enough she'll extract
compliments or yawns." And looking up at a chinless young man who
had halted near her: "George, Captain Selwyn has acquired such a
charmingly Oriental fluency during his residence in the East that I
thought&mdash;if you ever desired to travel again&mdash;" She
shrugged, and, glancing at Selwyn: "Have you met my husband? Oh, of
course."</p>
<p>They exchanged a commonplace or two, then other people separated
them without resistance on their part. And Selwyn found himself
drifting, mildly interested in the vapid exchange of civilities
which cost nobody a mental effort.</p>
<p>His sister, he had once thought, was certainly the most
delightfully youthful matron in New York. But now he made an
exception of Mrs. Fane; Rosamund Fane was much younger&mdash;must
have been younger, for she still had something of that volatile
freshness&mdash;that vague atmosphere of immaturity clinging to her
like a perfume almost too delicate to detect. And under that the
most profound capacity for mischief he had ever known of.
Sauntering amiably amid the glittering groups continually forming
and disintegrating under the clustered lights, he finally succeeded
in reaching his hostess.</p>
<p>And Mrs. T. West Minster disengaged herself from the throng with
intention as he approached.</p>
<p>No&mdash;and he was so sorry; and it was very amiable of his
hostess to want him, but he was not remaining for the dance.</p>
<p>So much for the hostess, who stood there massive and gem-laden,
her kindly and painted features tinted now with genuine
emotion.</p>
<p>"<i>Je m'accuse, mon fils</i>!&mdash;but you acted like a
perfect dear," she said. "<i>Mea culpa, mea culpa</i>; and
<i>can</i> you forgive a very much mortified old lady who is really
and truly fond of you?"</p>
<p>He laughed, holding her fat, ringed hands in both of his with
all the attractive deference that explained his popularity. Rising
excitement had sent the colour into his face and cleared his
pleasant gray eyes; and he looked very young and handsome, his
broad shoulders bent a trifle before the enamelled and bejewelled
matron.</p>
<p>"Forgive you?" he repeated with a laugh of protest; "on the
contrary, I thank you. Mrs. Ruthven is one of the most charming
women I know, if that is what you mean?"</p>
<p>Looking after him as he made his way toward the cloak room: "The
boy is thoroughbred," she reflected cynically; "and the only
amusement anybody can get out of it will be at my expense! Rosamund
is a perfect cat!"</p>
<hr style='width: 45%;' />
<p>He had sent for his cab, which, no doubt, was in line somewhere,
wedged among the ranks of carriages stretching east and west along
the snowy street; and he stood on the thick crimson carpet under
the awning while it was being summoned. A few people like himself
were not staying for the dance; others who had dined by
prearrangement with other hostesses, had now begun to arrive, and
the confusion grew as coach and brougham and motor came swaying up
through the falling snow to deposit their jewelled cargoes of silks
and laces under the vast awning picketed by policemen and lined
with fur-swathed grooms and spindle-legged chauffeurs in coats of
pony-skin.</p>
<p>The Cornelius Suydams, emerging from the house, offered Selwyn
tonneau room, but he smilingly declined, having a mind for solitude
and the Lenox Club. A phalanx of d&eacute;butantes, opera bound,
also left. Then the tide set heavily the other way, and there
seemed no end to the line of arriving vehicles and guests, until he
heard a name pronounced; a policeman warned back an approaching
Fiat; and Selwyn saw Mrs. Ruthven, enveloped in white furs, step
from the portal.</p>
<p>She saw him as he moved back, nodded, passed directly to her
brougham, and set foot on the step. Pausing here, she looked about
her, right and left, then over her shoulder straight back at
Selwyn; and as she stood in silence evidently awaiting him, it
became impossible for him any longer to misunderstand without a
public affront to her.</p>
<p>When he started toward her she spoke to her maid, and the latter
moved aside with a word to the groom in waiting.</p>
<p>"My maid will dismiss your carriage," she said pleasantly when
he halted beside her. "There is one thing more which I must say to
you."</p>
<p>Was this what he had expected hazard might bring to
him?&mdash;was this the prophecy of his hammering pulses?</p>
<p>"Please hurry before people come out," she added, and entered
the brougham.</p>
<p>"I can't do this," he muttered.</p>
<p>"I've sent away my maid," she said. "Nobody has noticed; those
are servants out there. Will you please come before anybody
arriving or departing does notice?"</p>
<p>And, as he did not move: "Are you going to make me conspicuous
by this humiliation before servants?"</p>
<p>He said something between his set teeth and entered the
brougham.</p>
<p>"Do you know what you've done?" he demanded harshly.</p>
<p>"Yes; nothing yet. But you would have done enough to stir this
borough if you had delayed another second."</p>
<p>"Your maid saw&mdash;"</p>
<p>"My maid is <i>my</i> maid."</p>
<p>He leaned back in his corner, gray eyes narrowing.</p>
<p>"Naturally," he said, "you are the one to be considered, not the
man in the case."</p>
<p>"Thank you. <i>Are</i> you the man in the case?"</p>
<p>"There is no case," he said coolly.</p>
<p>"Then why worry about me?"</p>
<p>He folded his arms, sullenly at bay; yet had no premonition of
what to expect from her.</p>
<p>"You were very brutal to me," she said at length.</p>
<p>"I know it; and I did not intend to be. The words came."</p>
<p>"You had me at your mercy; and showed me little&mdash;a very
little at first. Afterward, none."</p>
<p>"The words came," he repeated; "I'm sick with self-contempt, I
tell you."</p>
<p>She set her white-gloved elbow on the window sill and rested her
chin in her palm.</p>
<p>"That&mdash;money," she said with an effort. "You
set&mdash;some&mdash;aside for me."</p>
<p>"Half," he nodded calmly.</p>
<p>"Why?"</p>
<p>He was silent.</p>
<p>"<i>Why</i>? I did not ask for it? There was nothing in
the&mdash;the legal proceedings to lead you to believe that I
desired it; was there?"</p>
<p>"No."</p>
<p>"Well, then," her breath came unsteadily, "what was there in
<i>me</i> to make you think I would accept it?"</p>
<p>He did not reply.</p>
<p>"Answer me. This is the time to answer me."</p>
<p>"The answer is simple enough," he said in a low voice. "Together
we had made a failure of partnership. When that partnership was
dissolved, there remained the joint capital to be divided. And I
divided it. Why not?"</p>
<p>"That capital was yours in the beginning; not mine. What I had
of my own you never controlled; and I took it with me when I
went."</p>
<p>"It was very little," he said.</p>
<p>"What of that? Did that concern you? Did you think I would have
accepted anything from you? A thousand times I have been on the
point of notifying you through attorney that the deposit now
standing in my name is at your disposal."</p>
<p>"Why didn't you notify me then?" he asked, reddening to the
temples.</p>
<p>"Because&mdash;I did not wish to hurt you&mdash;by doing it that
way. . . . And I had not the courage to say it kindly over my own
signature. That is why, Captain Selwyn."</p>
<p>And, as he remained silent: "That is what I had to say; not
all&mdash;because&mdash;I wish to&mdash;to thank you for offering
it. . . . You did not have very much, either; and you divided what
you had. So I thank you&mdash;and I return it.". . . The tension
forced her to attempt a laugh. "So we stand once more on equal
terms; unless you have anything of mine to return&mdash;"</p>
<p>"I have your photograph," he said.</p>
<p>The silence lasted until he straightened up and, rubbing the fog
from the window glass, looked out.</p>
<p>"We are in the Park," he remarked, turning toward her.</p>
<p>"Yes; I did not know how long it might take to explain matters.
You are free of me now whenever you wish."</p>
<p>He picked up the telephone, hesitated: "Home?" he inquired with
an effort. And at the forgotten word they looked at one another in
stricken silence.</p>
<p>"Y-yes; to <i>your</i> home first, if you will let me drop you
there&mdash;"</p>
<p>"Thank you; that might be imprudent."</p>
<p>"No, I think not. You say you are living at the Gerards?"</p>
<p>"Yes, temporarily. But I've already taken another place."</p>
<p>"Where?"</p>
<p>"Oh, it's only a bachelor's kennel&mdash;a couple of
rooms&mdash;"</p>
<p>"Where, please?"</p>
<p>"Near Lexington and Sixty-sixth. I could go there; it's only
partly furnished yet&mdash;"</p>
<p>"Then tell Hudson to drive there."</p>
<p>"Thank you, but it is not necessary&mdash;"</p>
<p>"Please let me; tell Hudson, or I will."</p>
<p>"You are very kind," he said; and gave the order.</p>
<p>Silence grew between them like a wall. She lay back in her
corner, swathed to the eyes in her white furs; he in his corner sat
upright, arms loosely folded, staring ahead at nothing. After a
while he rubbed the moisture from the pane again.</p>
<p>"Still in the Park! He must have driven us nearly to Harlem
Mere. It <i>is</i> the Mere! See the caf&eacute; lights yonder. It
all looks rather gay through the snow."</p>
<p>"Very gay," she said, without moving. And, a moment later: "Will
you tell me something? . . . You see"&mdash;with a forced
laugh&mdash;"I can't keep my mind&mdash;from it."</p>
<p>"From what?" he asked.</p>
<p>"The&mdash;tragedy; ours."</p>
<p>"It has ceased to be that; hasn't it?"</p>
<p>"Has it? You said&mdash;you said that w-what I did to you was
n-not as terrible as what I d-did to myself."</p>
<p>"That is true," he admitted grimly.</p>
<p>"Well, then, may I ask my question?"</p>
<p>"Ask it, child."</p>
<p>"Then&mdash;are you happy?"</p>
<p>He did not answer.</p>
<p>"&mdash;Because I desire it, Philip. I want you to be. You will
be, won't you? I did not dream that I was ruining your army career
when I&mdash;went mad&mdash;"</p>
<p>"How did it happen, Alixe?" he asked, with a cold curiosity that
chilled her. "How did it come about?&mdash;wretched as we seemed to
be together&mdash;unhappy, incapable of understanding each
other&mdash;"</p>
<p>"Phil! There <i>were</i> days&mdash;"</p>
<p>He raised his eyes.</p>
<p>"You speak only of the unhappy ones," she said; "but there were
moments&mdash;"</p>
<p>"Yes; I know it. And so I ask you, <i>why</i>?"</p>
<p>"Phil, I don't know. There was that last bitter
quarrel&mdash;the night you left for Leyte after the dance. . . .
I&mdash;it all grew suddenly intolerable. <i>You</i> seemed so
horribly unreal&mdash;everything seemed unreal in that ghastly
city&mdash;you, I, our marriage of crazy impulse&mdash;the people,
the sunlight, the deathly odours, the torturing, endless creak of
the punkha. . . . It was not a question of&mdash;of love, of anger,
of hate. I tell you I was stunned&mdash;I had no emotions
concerning you or myself&mdash;after that last scene&mdash;only a
stupefied, blind necessity to get away; a groping instinct to move
toward home&mdash;to make my way home and be rid for ever of the
dream that drugged me! . . . And then&mdash;and then&mdash;"</p>
<p>"<i>He</i> came," said Selwyn very quietly. "Go on."</p>
<p>But she had nothing more to say.</p>
<p>"Alixe!"</p>
<p>She shook her head, closing her eyes.</p>
<p>"Little girl!&mdash;oh, little girl!" he said softly, the old
familiar phrase finding its own way to his lips&mdash;and she
trembled slightly; "was there no other way but that? Had marriage
made the world such a living hell for you that there was no other
way but <i>that</i>?"</p>
<p>"Phil, I helped to make it a hell."</p>
<p>"Yes&mdash;because I was pitiably inadequate to design anything
better for us. I didn't know how. I didn't understand. I, the
architect of our future&mdash;failed."</p>
<p>"It was worse than that, Phil; we"&mdash;she looked blindly at
him&mdash;"we had yet to learn what love might be. We did not know.
. . . If we could have waited&mdash;only
waited!&mdash;perhaps&mdash;because there <i>were</i>
moments&mdash;" She flushed crimson.</p>
<p>"I could not make you love me," he repeated; "I did not know
how."</p>
<p>"Because you yourself had not learned how. But&mdash;at
times&mdash;now looking back to it&mdash;I think&mdash;I think we
were very near to it&mdash;at moments. . . . And then that dreadful
dream closed down on us again. . . . And then&mdash;the end."</p>
<p>"If you could have held out," he breathed; "if I could have
helped! It was I who failed you after all!"</p>
<p>For a long while they sat in silence; Mrs. Ruthven's white furs
now covered her face. At last the carriage stopped.</p>
<p>As he sprang to the curb he became aware of another vehicle
standing in front of the house&mdash;a cab&mdash;from which Mrs.
Ruthven's maid descended.</p>
<p>"What is she doing here?" he asked, turning in astonishment to
Mrs. Ruthven.</p>
<p>"Phil," she said in a low voice, "I knew you had taken this
place. Gerald told me. Forgive me&mdash;but when I saw you under
the awning it came to me in a flash what to do. And I've done it. .
. . Are you sorry?"</p>
<p>"No. . . . Did Gerald tell you that I had taken this place?"</p>
<p>"Yes; I asked him."</p>
<p>Selwyn looked at her gravely; and she looked him very steadily
in the eyes.</p>
<p>"Before I go&mdash;may I say one more word?" he asked
gently.</p>
<p>"Yes&mdash;if you please. Is it about Gerald?"</p>
<p>"Yes. Don't let him gamble. . . . You saw the signature on that
check?"</p>
<p>"Yes, Phil."</p>
<p>"Then you understand. Don't let him do it again."</p>
<p>"No. And&mdash;Phil?"</p>
<p>"What?"</p>
<p>"That check is&mdash;is deposited to your credit&mdash;with the
rest. I have never dreamed of using it." Her cheeks were afire
again, but with shame this time.</p>
<p>"You will have to accept it, Alixe."</p>
<p>"I cannot."</p>
<p>"You must! Don't you see you will affront Gerald? He has repaid
me; that check is not mine, nor is it his."</p>
<p>"I can't take it," she said with a shudder. "What shall I do
with it?"</p>
<p>"There are ways&mdash;hospitals, if you care to. . . .
Good-night, child."</p>
<p>She stretched out her gloved arm to him; he took her hand very
gently and retained it while he spoke.</p>
<p>"I wish you happiness," he said; "I ask your forgiveness."</p>
<p>"Give me mine, then."</p>
<p>"Yes&mdash;if there is anything to forgive. Good-night."</p>
<p>"Good-night&mdash;boy," she gasped.</p>
<p>He turned sharply, quivering under the familiar name. Her maid,
standing in the snow, moved forward, and he motioned her to enter
the brougham.</p>
<p>"Home," he said unsteadily; and stood there very still for a
minute or two, even after the carriage had whirled away into the
storm. Then, looking up at the house, he felt for his keys; but a
sudden horror of being alone arrested him, and he stepped back,
calling out to his cabman, who was already turning his horse's
head, "Wait a moment; I think I'll drive back to Mrs. Gerard's. . .
. And take your time."</p>
<hr style='width: 45%;' />
<p>It was still early&mdash;lacking a quarter of an hour to
midnight&mdash;when he arrived. Nina had retired, but Austin sat in
the library, obstinately plodding through the last chapters of a
brand-new novel.</p>
<p>"This is a wretched excuse for sitting up," he yawned, laying
the book flat on the table, but still open. "I ought never to be
trusted alone with any book." Then he removed his reading glasses,
yawned again, and surveyed Selwyn from head to foot.</p>
<p>"Very pretty," he said. "Well, how are the yellow ones, Phil? Or
was it all d&eacute;butante and slop-twaddle?"</p>
<p>"Few from the cradle, but bunches were arriving for the dance as
I left."</p>
<p>"Eileen went at half-past eleven."</p>
<p>"I didn't know she was going," said Selwyn, surprised.</p>
<p>"She didn't want you to. The Playful Kitten business, you
know&mdash;frisks apropos of nothing to frisk about. But we all
fancied you'd stay for the dance." He yawned mightily, and gazed at
Selwyn with ruddy gravity.</p>
<p>"Whisk?" he inquired.</p>
<p>"No."</p>
<p>"Cigar?"&mdash;mildly urgent.</p>
<p>"No, thanks."</p>
<p>"Bed?"</p>
<p>"I think so. But don't wait for me, Austin. . . . Is that the
evening paper? Where is St. Paul?"</p>
<p>Austin passed it across the table and sat for a moment,
alternately yawning and skimming the last chapter of his novel.</p>
<p>"Stuff and rubbish, mush and piffle!" he muttered, closing the
book and pushing it from him across the table; "love, as usual,
grossly out of proportion to the ensemble. That theory of the
earth's rotation, you know; all these absurd books are built on it.
Why do men read 'em? They grin when they do it! Love is only the
sixth sense&mdash;just one-sixth of a man's existence. The other
five-sixths of his time he's using his other senses working for a
living."</p>
<p>Selwyn looked up over his newspaper, then lowered and folded
it.</p>
<p>"In these novels," continued Gerard, irritably, "five-sixths of
the pages are devoted to love; everything else is subordinated to
it; it controls all motives, it initiates all action, it drugs
reason, it prolongs the tuppenny suspense, sustains cheap
situations, and produces agonisingly profitable climaxes for the
authors. . . . Does it act that way in real life?"</p>
<p>"Not usually," said Selwyn.</p>
<p>"Nobody else thinks so, either. Why doesn't somebody tell the
truth? Why doesn't somebody tell us how a man sees a nice girl and
gradually begins to tag after her when business hours are over? A
respectable man is busy from eight or nine until five or six. In
the evening he's usually at the club, or dining out, or asleep;
isn't he? Well, then, how much time does it leave for love? Do the
problem yourself in any way you wish; the result is a fraction
every time; and that fraction represents the proper importance of
the love interest in its proper ratio to a man's entire life."</p>
<p>He sat up, greatly pleased with himself at having reduced
sentiment to a fixed proportion in the ingredients of life.</p>
<p>"If I had time," he said, "I could tell them how to write a
book&mdash;" He paused, musing, while the confident smile spread.
Selwyn stared at space.</p>
<p>"What does a young man know about love, anyway?" demanded his
brother-in-law.</p>
<p>"Nothing," replied Selwyn listlessly.</p>
<p>"Of course not. Look at Gerald. He sits on the stairs with a
pink and white ninny; and at the next party he does it with
another. That's wholesome and natural; and that's the way things
really are. Look at Eileen. Do you suppose she has the slightest
suspicion of what love is?"</p>
<p>"Naturally not," said Selwyn.</p>
<p>"Correct. Only a fool novelist would attribute the deeper
emotions to a child like that. What does she know about anything?
Love isn't a mere emotion, either&mdash;that is all fol-de-rol and
fizzle!&mdash;it's the false basis of modern romance. Love is
reason&mdash;not a nervous phenomenon. Love is a sane passion,
founded on a basic knowledge of good and evil. That's what love is;
the rest!"&mdash;he lifted the book, waved it contemptuously, and
pushed it farther away&mdash;"the rest is neuritis; the remedy a
pill. I'm going to bed; are you?"</p>
<p>But Selwyn had lighted a cigar, and was again unfolding his
evening paper; so his brother-in-law moved ponderously away,
yawning frightfully at every heavy stride, and the younger man
settled back in his chair, a fragrant cigar balanced between his
strong, slim fingers, one leg dropped loosely over the other. After
a while the newspaper fell to the floor.</p>
<p>He sat there without moving for a long time; his cigar, burning
close, had gone out. The reading-lamp spread a circle of soft light
over the floor; on the edge of it lay Kit-Ki, placid, staring at
him. After a while he noticed her. "You?" he said absently; "you
hid so they couldn't put you out."</p>
<p>At the sound of his voice she began to purr.</p>
<p>"Oh, it's all very well," he nodded; "but it's against the law.
However," he added, "I'm rather tired of rules and regulations
myself. Besides, the world outside is very cold to-night. Purr
away, old lady; I'm going to bed."</p>
<p>But he did not stir.</p>
<p>A little later, the fire having burned low, he rose, laid a pair
of heavy logs across the coals, dragged his chair to the hearth,
and settled down in it deeply. Then he lifted the cat to his knees.
Kit-Ki sang blissfully, spreading and relaxing her claws at
intervals as she gazed at the mounting blaze.</p>
<p>"I'm going to bed, Kit-Ki," he repeated absently, "because
that's a pretty good place for me . . . far better than sitting up
here with you&mdash;and conscience."</p>
<p>But he only lay back deeper in the velvet chair and lighted
another cigar.</p>
<p>"Kit-Ki," he said, "the words men utter count in the reckoning;
but not as heavily as the words men leave unuttered; and what a man
does scores deeply; but&mdash;alas for the scars of the deeds he
has left undone."</p>
<p>The logs were now wrapped in flame, and their low mellow roaring
mingled to a monotone with the droning of the cat on his knees.</p>
<p>Long after his cigar burnt bitter, he sat with eyes fixed on the
blaze. When the flames at last began to flicker and subside, his
lids fluttered, then drooped; but he had lost all reckoning of time
when he opened them again to find Miss Erroll in furs and ball-gown
kneeling on the hearth and heaping kindling on the coals, and her
pretty little Alsatian maid beside her, laying a log across the
andirons.</p>
<p>"Upon my word!" he murmured, confused; then rising quickly, "Is
that you, Miss Erroll? What time is it?"</p>
<p>"Four o'clock in the morning, Captain Selwyn," she said,
straightening up to her full height. "This room is icy; are you
frozen?"</p>
<p>Chilled through, he stood looking about in a dazed way,
incredulous of the hour and of his own slumber.</p>
<p>"I was conversing with Kit-Ki a moment ago," he protested, in
such a tone of deep reproach that Eileen laughed while her maid
relieved her of furs and scarf.</p>
<p>"Susanne, just unhook those two that I can't manage; light the
fire in my bedroom; <i>et merci bien, ma petite!</i>"</p>
<p>The little maid vanished; Kit-Ki, who had been unceremoniously
spilled from Selwyn's knees, sat yawning, then rose and walked
noiselessly to the hearth.</p>
<p>"I don't know how I happened to do it," he muttered, still
abashed by his plight.</p>
<p>"We rekindled the fire for your benefit," she said; "you had
better use it before you retire." And she seated herself in the
arm-chair, stretching out her ungloved hands to the
blaze&mdash;smooth, innocent hands, so soft, so amazingly fresh and
white.</p>
<p>He moved a step forward into the warmth, stood a moment, then
reached forward for a chair and drew it up beside hers.</p>
<p>"Do you mean to say you are not sleepy?" he asked.</p>
<p>"I? No, not in the least. I will be to-morrow, though."</p>
<p>"Did you have a good time?"</p>
<p>"Yes&mdash;rather."</p>
<p>"Wasn't it gay?"</p>
<p>"Gay? Oh, very."</p>
<p>Her replies were unusually short&mdash;almost preoccupied. She
was generally more communicative.</p>
<p>"You danced a lot, I dare say," he ventured.</p>
<p>"Yes&mdash;a lot," studying the floor.</p>
<p>"Decent partners?"</p>
<p>"Oh, yes."</p>
<p>"Who was there?"</p>
<p>She looked up at him. "<i>You</i> were not there," she said,
smiling.</p>
<p>"No; I cut it. But I did not know you were going; you said
nothing about it."</p>
<p>"Of course, you would have stayed if you had known, Captain
Selwyn?" She was still smiling.</p>
<p>"Of course," he replied.</p>
<p>"Would you really?"</p>
<p>"Why, yes."</p>
<p>There was something not perfectly familiar to him in the girl's
bright brevity, in her direct personal inquiry; for between them,
hitherto, the gaily impersonal had ruled except in moments of
lightest badinage.</p>
<p>"Was it an amusing dinner?" she asked, in her turn.</p>
<p>"Rather." Then he looked up at her, but she had stretched her
slim silk-shod feet to the fender, and her head was bent aside, so
that he could see only the curve of the cheek and the little
close-set ear under its ruddy mass of gold.</p>
<p>"Who was there?" she asked, too, carelessly.</p>
<p>For a moment he did not speak; under his bronzed cheek the flat
muscles stirred. Had some meddling, malicious fool ventured to
whisper an unfit jest to this young girl? Had a word&mdash;or a
smile and a phrase cut in two&mdash;awakened her to a sorry wisdom
at his expense? Something had happened; and the idea stirred him to
wrath&mdash;as when a child is wantonly frightened or a dumb
creature misused.</p>
<p>"What did you ask me?" he inquired gently.</p>
<p>"I asked you who was there, Captain Selwyn."</p>
<p>He recalled some names, and laughingly mentioned his dinner
partner's preference for Harmon. She listened absently, her chin
nestling in her palm, only the close-set, perfect ear turned toward
him.</p>
<p>"Who led the cotillion?" he asked.</p>
<p>"Jack Ruthven&mdash;dancing with Rosamund Fane."</p>
<p>She drew her feet from the fender and crossed them, still turned
away from him; and so they remained in silence until again she
shifted her position, almost impatiently.</p>
<p>"You are very tired," he said.</p>
<p>"No; wide awake."</p>
<p>"Don't you think it best for you to go to bed?"</p>
<p>"No. But you may go."</p>
<p>And, as he did not stir: "I mean that you are not to sit here
because I do." And she looked around at him.</p>
<p>"What has gone wrong, Eileen?" he said quietly.</p>
<p>He had never before used her given name, and she flushed up.</p>
<p>"There is nothing the matter, Captain Selwyn. Why do you
ask?"</p>
<p>"Yes, there is," he said.</p>
<p>"There is not, I tell you&mdash;"</p>
<p>"&mdash;And, if it is something you cannot understand," he
continued pleasantly, "perhaps it might be well to ask Nina to
explain it to you."</p>
<p>"There is nothing to explain."</p>
<p>"&mdash;Because," he went on, very gently, "one is sometimes led
by malicious suggestion to draw false and unpleasant inferences
from harmless facts&mdash;"</p>
<p>"Captain Selwyn&mdash;"</p>
<p>"Yes, Eileen."</p>
<p>But she could not go on; speech and thought itself remained
sealed; only a confused consciousness of being hurt
remained&mdash;somehow to be remedied by something he might
say&mdash;might deny. Yet how could it help her for him to deny
what she herself refused to believe?&mdash;refused through sheer
instinct while ignorant of its meaning.</p>
<p>Even if he had done what she heard Rosamund Fane say he had
done, it had remained meaningless to her save for the manner of the
telling. But now&mdash;but now! Why had they laughed&mdash;why had
their attitudes and manner and the disconnected phrases in French
left her flushed and rigid among the idle group at supper? Why had
they suddenly seemed to remember her presence&mdash;and express
their abrupt consciousness of it in such furtive signals and
silence?</p>
<p>It was false, anyway&mdash;whatever it meant. And, anyway, it
was false that he had driven away in Mrs. Ruthven's brougham. But,
oh, if he had only stayed&mdash;if he had only remained!&mdash;this
friend of hers who had been so nice to her from the moment he came
into her life&mdash;so generous, so considerate, so lovely to
her&mdash;and to Gerald!</p>
<p>For a moment the glow remained, then a chill doubt crept in;
would he have remained had he known she was to be there?
<i>Where</i> did he go after the dinner? As for what they said, it
was absurd. And yet&mdash;and yet&mdash;</p>
<p>He sat, savagely intent upon the waning fire; she turned
restlessly again, elbows close together on her knees, face framed
in her hands.</p>
<p>"You ask me if I am tired," she said. "I am&mdash;of the froth
of life."</p>
<p>His face changed instantly. "What?" he exclaimed, laughing.</p>
<p>But she, very young and seriously intent, was now wrestling with
the mighty platitudes of youth. First of all she desired to know
what meaning life held for humanity. Then she expressed a doubt as
to the necessity for human happiness; duty being her discovery as
sufficient substitute.</p>
<p>But he heard in her childish babble the minor murmur of an
undercurrent quickening for the first time; and he listened
patiently and answered gravely, touched by her irremediable
loneliness.</p>
<p>For Nina must remain but a substitute at best; what was wanting
must remain wanting; and race and blood must interpret for itself
the subtler and unasked questions of an innocence slowly awaking to
a wisdom which makes us all less wise.</p>
<p>So when she said that she was tired of gaiety, that she would
like to study, he said that he would take up anything she chose
with her. And when she spoke vaguely of a life devoted to good
works&mdash;of the wiser charity, of being morally equipped to aid
those who required material aid, he was very serious, but ventured
to suggest that she dance her first season through as a sort of
flesh-mortifying penance preliminary to her spiritual
novitiate.</p>
<p>"Yes," she admitted thoughtfully; "you are right. Nina would
feel dreadfully if I did not go on&mdash;or if she imagined I cared
so little for it all. But one season is enough to waste. Don't you
think so?"</p>
<p>"Quite enough," he assured her.</p>
<p>"&mdash;And&mdash;why should I ever marry?" she demanded,
lifting her clear, sweet eyes to his.</p>
<p>"Why indeed?" he repeated with conviction. "I can see no
reason."</p>
<p>"I am glad you understand me," she said. "I am not a marrying
woman."</p>
<p>"Not at all," he assured her.</p>
<p>"No, I am not; and Nina&mdash;the darling&mdash;doesn't
understand. Why, what do you suppose!&mdash;but <i>would</i> it be
a breach of confidence to anybody if I told you?"</p>
<p>"I doubt it," he said; "what is it you have to tell me?"</p>
<p>"Only&mdash;it's very, very silly&mdash;only several
men&mdash;and one nice enough to know better&mdash;Sudbury
Gray&mdash;"</p>
<p>"Asked you to marry them?" he finished, nodding his head at the
cat.</p>
<p>"Yes," she admitted, frankly astonished; "but how did you
know?"</p>
<p>"Inferred it. Go on."</p>
<p>"There is nothing more," she said, without embarrassment. "I
told Nina each time; but she confused me by asking for details; and
the details were too foolish and too annoying to repeat. . . . I do
not wish to marry anybody. I think I made that very plain
to&mdash;everybody."</p>
<p>"Right as usual," he said cheerfully; "you are too intelligent
to consider that sort of thing just now."</p>
<p>"You <i>do</i> understand me, don't you?" she said gratefully.
"There are so many serious things in life to learn and to think of,
and that is the very last thing I should ever consider. . . . I am
very, very glad I had this talk with you. Now I am rested and I
shall retire for a good long sleep."</p>
<p>With which paradox she stood up, stifling a tiny yawn, and
looked smilingly at him, all the old sweet confidence in her eyes.
Then, suddenly mocking:</p>
<p>"Who suggested that you call me by my first name?" she
asked.</p>
<p>"Some good angel or other. May I?"</p>
<p>"If you please; I rather like it. But I couldn't very well call
you anything except 'Captain Selwyn.'"</p>
<p>"On account of my age?"</p>
<p>"Your <i>age</i>!"&mdash;contemptuous in her confident
equality.</p>
<p>"Oh, my wisdom, then? You probably reverence me too deeply."</p>
<p>"Probably not. I don't know; I couldn't do
it&mdash;somehow&mdash;"</p>
<p>"Try it&mdash;unless you're afraid."</p>
<p>"I'm not afraid!"</p>
<p>"Yes, you are, if you don't take a dare."</p>
<p>"You dare me?"</p>
<p>"I do."</p>
<p>"Philip," she said, hesitating, adorable in her embarrassment.
"No! No! No! I can't do it that way in cold blood. It's got to be
'Captain Selwyn'. . . for a while, anyway. . . . Good-night."</p>
<p>He took her outstretched hand, laughing; the usual little
friendly shake followed; then she turned gaily away, leaving him
standing before the whitening ashes.</p>
<p>He thought the fire was dead; but when he turned out the lamp an
hour later, under the ashes embers glowed in the darkness of the
winter morning.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_IV" id="CHAPTER_IV"></a>CHAPTER IV</h2>
<h3>MID-LENT</h3>
<p>"Mid-Lent, and the Enemy grins," remarked Selwyn as he started
for church with Nina and the children. Austin, knee-deep in a dozen
Sunday supplements, refused to stir; poor little Eileen was now
convalescent from grippe, but still unsteady on her legs; her maid
had taken the grippe, and now moaned all day: "<i>Mon dieu! Mon
dieu! Che fais mourir!</i>"</p>
<p>Boots Lansing called to see Eileen, but she wouldn't come down,
saying her nose was too pink. Drina entertained Boots, and then
Selwyn returned and talked army talk with him until tea was served.
Drina poured tea very prettily; Nina had driven Austin to vespers.
The family dined at seven so Drina could sit up; special treat on
account of Boots's presence at table. Gerald was expected, but did
not come.</p>
<p>The next morning, Selwyn went downtown at the usual hour and
found Gerald, pale and shaky, hanging over his desk and trying to
dictate letters to an uncomfortable stenographer.</p>
<p>So he dismissed the abashed girl for the moment, closed the
door, and sat down beside the young man.</p>
<p>"Go home, Gerald" he said with decision; "when Neergard comes in
I'll tell him you are not well. And, old fellow, don't ever come
near the office again when you're in this condition."</p>
<p>"I'm a perfect fool," faltered the boy, his voice trembling; "I
don't really care for that sort of thing, either; but you know how
it is in that set&mdash;"</p>
<p>"What set?"</p>
<p>"Oh, the Fanes&mdash;the Ruthv&mdash;" He stammered himself into
silence.</p>
<p>"I see. What happened last night?"</p>
<p>"The usual; two tables full of it. There was a wheel, too. . . .
I had no intention&mdash;but you know yourself how it parches your
throat&mdash;the jollying and laughing and excitement. . . . I
forgot all about what you&mdash;what we talked over. . . . I'm
ashamed and sorry; but I can stay here and attend to things, of
course&mdash;"</p>
<p>"I don't want Neergard to see you," repeated Selwyn.</p>
<p>"W-why," stammered the boy, "do I look as rocky as that?"</p>
<p>"Yes. See here, you are not afraid of me, are you?"</p>
<p>"No&mdash;"</p>
<p>"You don't think I'm one of those long-faced, blue-nosed
butters-in, do you? You have confidence in me, haven't you? You
know I'm an average and normally sinful man who has made plenty of
mistakes and who understands how others make them&mdash;you know
that, don't you, old chap?"</p>
<p>"Y-es."</p>
<p>"Then you <i>will</i> listen, won't you, Gerald?"</p>
<p>The boy laid his arms on the desk and hid his face in them. Then
he nodded.</p>
<p>For ten minutes Selwyn talked to him with all the terse and
colloquial confidence of a comradeship founded upon respect for
mutual fallibility. No instruction, no admonition, no blame, no
reproach&mdash;only an affectionately logical review of matters as
they stood&mdash;and as they threatened to stand.</p>
<p>The boy, fortunately, was still pliable and susceptible, still
unalarmed and frank. It seemed that he had lost money
again&mdash;this time to Jack Ruthven; and Selwyn's teeth remained
sternly interlocked as, bit by bit, the story came out. But in the
telling the boy was not quite as frank as he might have been; and
Selwyn supposed he was able to stand his loss without seeking
aid.</p>
<p>"Anyway," said Gerald in a muffled voice, "I've learned one
lesson&mdash;that a business man can't acquire the habits and keep
the infernal hours that suit people who can take all day to sleep
it off."</p>
<p>"Right," said Selwyn.</p>
<p>"Besides, my income can't stand it," added Gerald
na&iuml;vely.</p>
<p>"Neither could mine, old fellow. And, Gerald, cut out this card
business; it's the final refuge of the feebleminded. . . . You like
it? Oh, well, if you've got to play&mdash;if you've no better
resource for leisure, and if non-participation isolates you too
completely from other idiots&mdash;play the imbecile gentleman's
game; which means a game where nobody need worry over the
stakes."</p>
<p>"But&mdash;they'd laugh at me!"</p>
<p>"I know; but Boots Lansing wouldn't&mdash;and you have
considerable respect for him."</p>
<p>Gerald nodded; he had immediately succumbed to Lansing like
everybody else.</p>
<p>"And one thing more," said Selwyn; "don't play for
stakes&mdash;no matter how insignificant&mdash;where women sit in
the game. Fashionable or not, it is rotten sport&mdash;whatever the
ethics may be. And, Gerald, tainted sport and a clean record can't
take the same fence together."</p>
<p>The boy looked up, flushed and perplexed. "Why, every woman in
town&mdash;"</p>
<p>"Oh, no. How about your sister and mine?"</p>
<p>"Of course not; they are different. Only&mdash;well, you approve
of Rosamund Fane and&mdash;Gladys Orchil&mdash;don't you?"</p>
<p>"Gerald, men don't ask each other such questions&mdash;except as
you ask, without expecting or desiring an answer from me, and
merely to be saying something nice about two pretty women."</p>
<p>The reproof went home, deeply, but without a pang; and the boy
sat silent, studying the blotter between his elbows.</p>
<p>A little later he started for home at Selwyn's advice. But the
memory of his card losses frightened him, and he stopped on the way
to see what money Austin would advance him.</p>
<p>Julius Neergard came up from Long Island, arriving at the office
about noon. The weather was evidently cold on Long Island; he had
the complexion of a raw ham, but the thick, fat hand, with its
bitten nails, which he offered Selwyn as he entered his office, was
unpleasantly hot, and, on the thin nose which split the broad
expanse of face, a bead or two of sweat usually glistened, winter
and summer.</p>
<p>"Where's Gerald?" he asked as an office-boy relieved him of his
heavy box coat and brought his mail to him.</p>
<p>"I advised Gerald to go home," observed Selwyn carelessly; "he
is not perfectly well."</p>
<p>Neergard's tiny mouse-like eyes, set close together, stole
brightly in Selwyn's direction; but they usually looked just a
little past a man, seldom at him.</p>
<p>"Grippe?" he asked.</p>
<p>"I don't think so," said Selwyn.</p>
<p>"Lots of grippe 'round town," observed Neergard, as though
satisfied that Gerald had it. Then he sat down and rubbed his
large, membranous ears.</p>
<p>"Captain Selwyn," he began, "I'm satisfied that it's a devilish
good thing."</p>
<p>"Are you?"</p>
<p>"Emphatically. I've mastered the details&mdash;virtually all of
'em. Here's the situation in a grain of wheat!&mdash;the Siowitha
Club owns a thousand or so acres of oak scrub, pine scrub, sand and
weeds, and controls four thousand more; that is to say&mdash;the
club pays the farmers' rents and fixes their fences and awards them
odd jobs and prizes for the farm sustaining the biggest number of
bevies. Also the club pays them to maintain the millet and
buckwheat patches and to act as wardens. In return the farmers post
their four thousand acres for the exclusive benefit of the club. Is
that plain?"</p>
<p>"Perfectly."</p>
<p>"Very well, then. Now the Siowitha is largely composed of very
rich men&mdash;among them Bradley Harmon, Jack Ruthven, George
Fane, Sanxon Orchil, the Hon. Delmour-Carnes&mdash;<i>that</i>
crowd&mdash;rich and stingy. That's why they are contented with a
yearly agreement with the farmers instead of buying the four
thousand acres. Why put a lot of good money out of commission when
they can draw interest on it and toss an insignificant fraction of
that interest as a sop to the farmers? Do you see? That's your
millionaire method&mdash;and it's what makes 'em in the first
place."</p>
<p>He drew a large fancy handkerchief from his pistol-pocket and
wiped the beads from the bridge of his limber nose. But they
reappeared again.</p>
<p>"Now," he said, "I am satisfied that, working very carefully, we
can secure options on every acre of the four thousand. There is
money in it either way and any way we work it; we get it coming and
going. First of all, if the Siowitha people find that they really
cannot get on without controlling these acres&mdash;why"&mdash;and
he snickered so that his nose curved into a thin, ruddy
beak&mdash;"why, Captain, I suppose we <i>could</i> let them have
the land. Eh? Oh, yes&mdash;if they <i>must</i> have it!"</p>
<p>Selwyn frowned slightly.</p>
<p>"But the point is," continued Neergard, "that it borders the
railroad on the north; and where the land is not wavy it's flat as
a pancake, and"&mdash;he sank his husky voice&mdash;"it's fairly
riddled with water. I paid a thousand dollars for six tests."</p>
<p>"Water!" repeated Selwyn wonderingly; "why, it's dry as a
desert!"</p>
<p>"<i>Underground water</i>!&mdash;only about forty feet on the
average. Why, man, I can hit a well flowing three thousand gallons
almost anywhere. It's a gold mine. I don't care what you do with
the acreage&mdash;split it up into lots and advertise, or club the
Siowitha people into submission&mdash;it's all the same; it's a
gold mine&mdash;to be swiped and developed. Now there remains the
title searching and the damnable job of financing it&mdash;because
we've got to move cautiously, and knock softly at the doors of the
money vaults, or we'll be waking up some Wall Street relatives or
secret business associates of the yellow crowd; and if anybody
bawls for help we'll be up in the air next New Year's, and still
hiking skyward."</p>
<p>He stood up, gathering together the mail matter which his
secretary had already opened for his attention. "There's plenty of
time yet; their leases were renewed the first of this year, and
they'll run the year out. But it's something to think about. Will
you talk to Gerald, or shall I?"</p>
<p>"You," said Selwyn. "I'll think the matter over and give you my
opinion. May I speak to my brother-in-law about it?"</p>
<p>Neergard turned in his tracks and looked almost at him.</p>
<p>"Do you think there's any chance of his financing the
thing?"</p>
<p>"I haven't the slightest idea of what he might do.
Especially"&mdash;he hesitated&mdash;"as you never have had any
loans from his people&mdash;I understand&mdash;"</p>
<p>"No," said Neergard; "I haven't."</p>
<p>"It's rather out of their usual, I believe&mdash;"</p>
<p>"So they say. But Long Island acreage needn't beg favours now.
That's all over, Captain Selwyn. Fane, Harmon &amp; Co. know that;
Mr. Gerard ought to know it, too."</p>
<p>Selwyn looked troubled. "Shall I consult Mr. Gerard?" he
repeated. "I should like to if you have no objection."</p>
<p>Neergard's small, close-set eyes were focused on a spot just
beyond Selwyn's left shoulder.</p>
<p>"Suppose you sound him," he suggested, "in strictest&mdash;"</p>
<p>"Naturally," cut in Selwyn dryly; and turning to his littered
desk, opened the first letter his hand encountered. Now that his
head was turned, Neergard looked full at the back of his neck for a
long minute, then went out silently.</p>
<hr style='width: 45%;' />
<p>That night Selwyn stopped at his sister's house before going to
his own rooms, and, finding Austin alone in the library, laid the
matter before him exactly as Neergard had put it.</p>
<p>"You see," he added, "that I'm a sort of an ass about business
methods. What I like&mdash;what I understand, is to use good
judgment, go in and boldly buy a piece of property, wait until it
becomes more valuable, either through improvements or the natural
enhancement of good value, then take a legitimate profit, and
repeat the process. That, in outline, is what I understand. But,
Austin, this furtive pouncing on a thing and clubbing other
people's money out of them with it&mdash;this slyly acquiring land
that is necessary to an unsuspecting neighbour and then holding him
up&mdash;I don't like. There's always something of this sort that
prevents my cordial co-operation with Neergard&mdash;always
something in the schemes which hints of&mdash;of squeezing&mdash;of
something underground&mdash;"</p>
<p>"Like the water which he's going to squeeze out of the
wells?"</p>
<p>Selwyn laughed.</p>
<p>"Phil," said his brother-in-law, "if you think anybody can do a
profitable business except at other people's expense, you are an
ass."</p>
<p>"Am I?" asked Selwyn, still laughing frankly.</p>
<p>"Certainly. The land is there, plain enough for anybody to see.
It's always been there; it's likely to remain for a few &aelig;ons,
I fancy.</p>
<p>"Now, along comes Meynheer Julius Neergard&mdash;the only man
who seems to have brains enough to see the present value of that
parcel to the Siowitha people. Everybody else had the same chance;
nobody except Neergard knew enough to take it. Why shouldn't he
profit by it?"</p>
<p>"Yes&mdash;but if he'd be satisfied to cut it up into lots and
do what is fair&mdash;"</p>
<p>"Cut it up into nothing! Man alive, do you suppose the Siowitha
people would let him? They've only a few thousand acres; they've
<i>got</i> to control that land. What good is their club without
it? Do you imagine they'd let a town grow up on three sides of
their precious game-preserve? And, besides, I'll bet you that half
of their streams and lakes take rise on other people's
property&mdash;and that Neergard knows it&mdash;the Dutch fox!"</p>
<p>"That sort of&mdash;of business&mdash;that kind of coercion,
does not appeal to me," said Selwyn gravely.</p>
<p>"Then you'd better go into something besides business in this
town," observed Austin, turning red. "Good Lord, man, where would
my Loan and Trust Company be if we never foreclosed, never
swallowed a good thing when we see it?"</p>
<p>"But you don't threaten people."</p>
<p>Austin turned redder. "If people or corporations stand in our
way and block progress, of course we threaten. Threaten? Isn't the
threat of punishment the very basis of law and order itself? What
are laws for? And we have laws, too&mdash;laws, under the
law&mdash;"</p>
<p>"Of the State of New Jersey," said Selwyn, laughing. "Don't
flare up, Austin; I'm probably not cut out for a business career,
as you point out&mdash;otherwise I would not have consulted you. I
know some laws&mdash;including 'The Survival of the Fittest,' and
the 'Chain-of-Destruction'; and I have read the poem beginning</p>
<div class='blockquot'>"'Big bugs have little bugs to bite
'em.'</div>
<p>"That's all right, too; but speaking of laws, I'm always trying
to formulate one for my particular self-government; and you don't
mind, do you?"</p>
<p>"No," said Gerard, much amused, "I don't mind. Only when you
talk ethics&mdash;talk sense at the same time."</p>
<p>"I wish I knew how," he said.</p>
<p>They discussed Neergard's scheme for a little while longer;
Austin, shrewd and cautious, declined any personal part in the
financing of the deal, although he admitted the probability of
prospective profits.</p>
<p>"Our investments and our loans are of a different character," he
explained, "but I have no doubt that Fane, Harmon &amp;
Co.&mdash;"</p>
<p>"Why, both Fane and Harmon are members of the club!" laughed
Selwyn. "You don't expect Neergard to go to them?"</p>
<p>A peculiar expression flickered in Gerard's heavy features;
perhaps he thought that Fane and Harmon and Jack Ruthven were not
above exploiting their own club under certain circumstances. But
whatever his opinion, he said nothing further; and, suggesting that
Selwyn remain to dine, went off to dress.</p>
<p>A few moments later he returned, crestfallen and
conciliatory:</p>
<p>"I forgot, Nina and I are dining at the Orchils. Come up a
moment; she wants to speak to you."</p>
<p>So they took the rose-tinted rococo elevator; Austin went away
to his own quarters, and Selwyn tapped at Nina's boudoir.</p>
<p>"Is that you, Phil? One minute; Watson is finishing my hair. . .
. Come in, now; and kindly keep your distance, my friend. Do you
suppose I want Rosamund to know what brand of war-paint I use?"</p>
<p>"Rosamund," he repeated, with a good-humoured shrug; "it's
likely&mdash;isn't it?"</p>
<p>"Certainly it's likely. You'd never know you were telling her
anything&mdash;but she'd extract every detail in ten seconds. . . .
I understand she adores you, Phil. What have you done to her?"</p>
<p>"That's likely, too," he remarked, remembering his savagely
polite rebuke to that young matron after the Minster dinner.</p>
<p>"Well, she does; you've probably piqued her; that's the sort of
man she likes. . . . Look at my hair&mdash;how bright and wavy it
is, Phil. Tell me, <i>do</i> I appear fairly pretty to-night?"</p>
<p>"You're all right, Nina; I mean it," he said. "How are the kids?
How is Eileen?"</p>
<p>"That's why I sent for you. Eileen is furious at being left here
all alone; she's practically well and she's to dine with Drina in
the library. Would you be good enough to dine there with them?
Eileen, poor child, is heartily sick of her imprisonment; it would
be a mercy, Phil."</p>
<p>"Why, yes, I'll do it, of course; only I've some matters at
home&mdash;"</p>
<p>"Home! You call those stuffy, smoky, impossible, half-furnished
rooms <i>home</i>! Phil, when are you ever going to get some pretty
furniture and art things? Eileen and I have been talking it over,
and we've decided to go there and see what you need and then order
it, whether you like it or not."</p>
<p>"Thanks," he said, laughing; "it's just what I've tried to
avoid. I've got things where I want them now&mdash;but I knew it
was too comfortable to last. Boots said that some woman would be
sure to be good to me with an art-nouveau rocking-chair."</p>
<p>"A perfect sample of man's gratitude," said Nina, exasperated;
"for I've ordered two beautiful art-nouveau rocking-chairs, one for
you and one for Mr. Lansing. Now you can go and humiliate poor
little Eileen, who took so much pleasure in planning with me for
your comfort. As for your friend Boots, he's unspeakable&mdash;with
my compliments."</p>
<p>Selwyn stayed until he made peace with his sister, then he
mounted to the nursery to "lean over" the younger children and
preside at prayers. This being accomplished, he descended to the
library, where Eileen Erroll in a filmy, lace-clouded gown, full of
turquoise tints, reclined with her arm around Drina amid heaps of
cushions, watching the waitress prepare a table for two.</p>
<p>He took the fresh, cool hand she extended and sat down on the
edge of her couch.</p>
<p>"All O.K. again?" he inquired, retaining Eileen's hand in
his.</p>
<p>"Thank you&mdash;quite. Are you really going to dine with us?
Are you sure you want to? Oh, I know you've given up some very gay
dinner somewhere&mdash;"</p>
<p>"I was going to dine with Boots when Nina rescued me. Poor
Boots!&mdash;I think I'll telephone&mdash;"</p>
<p>"Telephone him to come here!" begged Drina. "Would he come? Oh,
please&mdash;I'd love to have him."</p>
<p>"I wish you would ask him," said Eileen; "it's been so lonely
and stupid to lie in bed with a red nose and fishy eyes and pains
in one's back and limbs. Please do let us have a party."</p>
<div class="figcenter"><a href=

<b>"'Two pillows,' said Drina sweetly."</b>
<br /></div>
<p>So Selwyn went to the telephone, and presently returned, saying
that Boots was overwhelmed and would be present at the festivities;
and Drina, enraptured, ordered flowers to be brought from the
dining-room and a large table set for four, with particular pomp
and circumstance.</p>
<p>Mr. Archibald Lansing arrived very promptly&mdash;a short,
stocky young man of clean and powerful build, with dark, keen eyes
always alert, and humorous lips ever on the edge of laughter under
his dark moustache.</p>
<p>His manner with Drina was always delightful&mdash;a mixture of
self-repressed idolatry and busily na&iuml;ve belief in a thorough
understanding between them to exclude Selwyn from their
company.</p>
<p>"This Selwyn fellow here!" he exclaimed. "I warned him over the
'phone we'd not tolerate him, Drina. I explained to him very
carefully that you and I were dining together in strictest
privacy&mdash;"</p>
<p>"He begged so hard," said Eileen. "Will somebody place an extra
pillow for Drina?"</p>
<p>They seized the same pillow fiercely, confronting each other;
massacre appeared imminent.</p>
<p>"<i>Two</i> pillows," said Drina sweetly; and extermination was
averted. The child laughed happily, covering one of Boots's hands
with both of hers.</p>
<p>"So you've left the service, Mr. Lansing?" began Eileen, lying
back and looking smilingly at Boots.</p>
<p>"Had to, Miss Erroll. Seven millionaires ran into my quarters
and chased me out and down Broadway into the offices of the
Westchester Air Line Company. Then these seven merciless
multi-millionaires in buckram bound and gagged me, stuffed my
pockets full of salary, and forced me to typewrite a fearful and
secret oath to serve them for five long, weary years. That's a
sample of how the wealthy grind the noses of the poor, isn't it,
Drina?"</p>
<p>The child slipped her hand from his, smiling uncertainly.</p>
<p>"You don't mean all that, do you?"</p>
<p>"Indeed I do, sweetheart."</p>
<p>"Are you not a soldier lieutenant any more, then?" she inquired,
horribly disappointed.</p>
<p>"Only a private in the workman's battalion, Drina."</p>
<p>"I don't care," retorted the child obstinately; "I like you just
as much."</p>
<p>"Have you really done it?" asked Selwyn as the first course was
served.</p>
<p>"<i>I?</i> No. <i>They?</i> Yes. We'll probably lose the
Philippines now," he added gloomily; "but it's my thankless
country's fault; you all had a chance to make me dictator, you
know. Miss Erroll, do you want a second-hand sword? Of course there
are great dents in it&mdash;"</p>
<p>"I'd rather have those celebrated boots," she replied demurely;
and Mr. Lansing groaned.</p>
<p>"How tall you're growing, Drina," remarked Selwyn.</p>
<p>"Probably the early spring weather," added Boots. "You're
twelve, aren't you?"</p>
<p>"Thirteen," said Drina gravely.</p>
<p>"Almost time to elope with me," nodded Boots.</p>
<p>"I'll do it now," she said&mdash;"as soon as my new gowns are
made&mdash;if you'll take me to Manila. Will you? I believe my Aunt
Alixe is there&mdash;"</p>
<p>She caught Eileen's eye and stopped short. "I forgot," she
murmured; "I beg your pardon, Uncle Philip&mdash;"</p>
<p>Boots was talking very fast and laughing a great deal; Eileen's
plate claimed her undivided attention; Selwyn quietly finished his
claret; the child looked at them all.</p>
<p>"By the way," said Boots abruptly, "what's the matter with
Gerald? He came in before noon looking very seedy&mdash;" Selwyn
glanced up quietly.</p>
<p>"Wasn't he at the office?" asked Eileen anxiously.</p>
<p>"Oh, yes," replied Selwyn; "he felt a trifle under the weather,
so I sent him home."</p>
<p>"Is it the grippe?"</p>
<p>"N-no, I believe not&mdash;"</p>
<p>"Do you think he had better have a doctor? Where is he?"</p>
<p>"He was here," observed Drina composedly, "and father was angry
with him."</p>
<p>"What?" exclaimed Eileen. "When?"</p>
<p>"This morning, before father went downtown."</p>
<p>Both Selwyn and Lansing cut in coolly, dismissing the matter
with a careless word or two; and coffee was served&mdash;cambric
tea in Drina's case.</p>
<p>"Come on," said Boots, slipping a bride-rose into Drina's curls;
"I'm ready for confidences."</p>
<p>"Confidences" had become an established custom with Drina and
Boots; it meant that every time they saw one another they were
pledged to tell each other everything that had occurred in their
lives since their last meeting.</p>
<p>So Drina, excitedly requesting to be excused, jumped up and,
taking Lansing's hand in hers, led him to a sofa in a distant
corner, where they immediately installed themselves and began an
earnest and whispered exchange of confidences, punctuated by little
whirlwinds of laughter from the child.</p>
<p>Eileen settled deeper among her pillows as the table was
removed, and Selwyn drew his chair forward.</p>
<p>"Suppose," she said, looking thoughtfully at him, "that you and
I make a vow to exchange confidences? Shall we, Captain
Selwyn?"</p>
<p>"Good heavens," he protested; "I&mdash;confess to <i>you</i>!
You'd faint dead away, Eileen."</p>
<p>"Perhaps. . . . But will you?"</p>
<p>He gaily evaded an answer, and after a while he fancied she had
forgotten. They spoke of other things, of her convalescence, of the
engagements she had been obliged to cancel, of the stupid hours in
her room&mdash;doubly stupid, as the doctor had not permitted her
to read or sew.</p>
<p>"And every day violets from you," she said; "it was certainly
nice of you. And&mdash;do you know that somehow&mdash;just because
you have never yet failed me&mdash;I thought perhaps&mdash;when I
asked your confidence a moment ago&mdash;"</p>
<p>He looked up quickly.</p>
<p>"<i>What</i> is the matter with Gerald?" she asked. "Could you
tell me?"</p>
<p>"Nothing serious is the matter, Eileen."</p>
<p>"Is he not ill?"</p>
<p>"Not very."</p>
<p>She lay still a moment, then with the slightest gesture: "Come
here."</p>
<p>He seated himself near her; she laid her hand fearlessly on his
arm.</p>
<p>"Tell me," she demanded. And, as he remained silent: "Once," she
said, "I came suddenly into the library. Austin and Gerald were
there; Austin seemed to be very angry with my brother. I heard him
say something that worried me; and I slipped out before they saw
me."</p>
<p>Selwyn remained silent.</p>
<p>"Was <i>that</i> it?"</p>
<p>"I&mdash;don't know what you heard."</p>
<p>"<i>Don't</i> you understand me?"</p>
<p>"Not exactly."</p>
<p>"Well, then"&mdash;she crimsoned&mdash;"has Gerald m-misbehaved
again?"</p>
<p>"What did you hear Austin say?" he demanded.</p>
<p>"I heard&mdash;something about dissipation. He was very angry
with Gerald. It is not the best way, I think, to become angry with
either of us&mdash;either me or Gerald&mdash;because then we are
usually inclined to do it again&mdash;whatever it is. . . . I do
not mean for one moment to be disloyal to Austin; you know that. .
. . But I am so thankful that Gerald is fond of you. . . . You like
him, too, don't you?"</p>
<p>"I am very fond of him."</p>
<p>"Well, then," she said, "you will talk to him
pleasantly&mdash;won't you? He is <i>such</i> a boy; and he adores
you. It is easy to influence a boy like that, you know&mdash;easy
to shame him out of the silly things he does. . . . That is all the
confidence I wanted, Captain Selwyn. And you haven't told me a
word, you see&mdash;and I have not fainted&mdash;have I?"</p>
<p>They laughed a little; her fingers, which had tightened on his
arm, relaxed; her hand fell away, and she straightened up, sitting
Turk fashion, and smoothing her hair which contact with the pillows
had disarranged so that it threatened to come tumbling over eyes
and cheeks.</p>
<p>"Oh, hair, hair!" she murmured, "you're Nina's despair and my
endless punishment. I'd twist and pin you tight if I
dared&mdash;some day I will, too. . . . What are you looking at so
curiously, Captain Selwyn? My mop?"</p>
<p>"It's about the most stunningly beautiful thing I ever saw," he
said, still curious.</p>
<p>She nodded gaily, both hands still busy with the lustrous
strands. "It <i>is</i> nice; but I never supposed you noticed it.
It falls to my waist; I'll show it to you some time. . . . But I
had no idea <i>you</i> noticed such things," she repeated, as
though to herself.</p>
<p>"Oh, I'm apt to notice all sorts of things," he said, looking so
provokingly wise that she dropped her hair and clapped both hands
over her eyes.</p>
<p>"Now," she said, "if you are so observing, you'll know the
colour of my eyes. What are they?"</p>
<p>"Blue&mdash;with a sort of violet tint," he said promptly.</p>
<p>She laughed and lowered her hands.</p>
<p>"All that personal attention paid to me!" she exclaimed. "You
are turning my head, Captain Selwyn. Besides, you are astonishing
me, because you never seem to know what women wear or what they
resemble when I ask you to describe the girls with whom you have
been dining or dancing."</p>
<p>It was a new note in their cordial intimacy&mdash;this nascent
intrusion of the personal. To her it merely meant his very charming
recognition of her maturity&mdash;she was fast becoming a woman
like other women, to be looked at and remembered as an individual,
and no longer classed vaguely as one among hundreds of the newly
emerged whose soft, unexpanded personalities all resembled one
another.</p>
<p>For some time, now, she had cherished this tiny grudge in her
heart&mdash;that he had never seemed to notice anything in
particular about her except when he tried to be agreeable
concerning some new gown. The contrast had become the sharper, too,
since she had awakened to the admiration of other men. And the
awakening was only a half-convinced happiness mingled with shy
surprise that the wise world should really deem her so lovely.</p>
<p>"A red-headed girl," she said teasingly; "I thought you had
better taste than&mdash;than&mdash;"</p>
<p>"Than to think you a raving beauty?"</p>
<p>"Oh," she said, "you don't think that!"</p>
<p>As a matter of fact he himself had become aware of it so
suddenly that he had no time to think very much about it. It was
rather strange, too, that he had not always been aware of it; or
was it partly the mellow light from the lamp tinting her till she
glowed and shimmered like a young sorceress, sitting so straight
there in her turquoise silk and misty lace?</p>
<p>Delicate luminous shadow banded her eyes; her hair, partly in
shadow, too, became a sombre mystery in rose-gold.</p>
<p>"Whatever <i>are</i> you staring at?" she laughed. "Me? I don't
believe it! Never have you so honoured me with your fixed
attention, Captain Selwyn. You really glare at me as though I were
interesting. And I know you don't consider me that; do you?"</p>
<p>"How old are you, anyway?" he asked curiously.</p>
<p>"Thank you, I'll be delighted to inform you when I'm
twenty."</p>
<p>"You look like a mixture of fifteen and twenty-five to-night,"
he said deliberately; "and the answer is more and less than
nineteen."</p>
<p>"And you," she said, "talk like a frivolous sage, and your
wisdom is as weighty as the years you carry. And what is the answer
to that? Do you know, Captain Selwyn, that when you talk to me this
way you look about as inexperienced as Gerald?"</p>
<p>"And do <i>you</i> know," he said, "that I feel as
inexperienced&mdash;when I talk to you this way?"</p>
<p>She nodded. "It's probably good for us both; I age, you renew
the frivolous days of youth when you were young enough to notice
the colour of a girl's hair and eyes. Besides, I'm very grateful to
you. Hereafter you won't dare sit about and cross your knees and
look like the picture of an inattentive young man by Gibson. You've
admitted that you like two of my features, and I shall expect you
to notice and <i>admit</i> that you notice the rest."</p>
<p>"I admit it now," he said, laughing.</p>
<p>"You mustn't; I won't let you. Two kinds of dessert are
sufficient at a time. But to-morrow&mdash;or perhaps the day after,
you may confess to me your approbation of one more
feature&mdash;only one, remember!&mdash;just one more agreeable
feature. In that way I shall be able to hold out for quite a while,
you see&mdash;counting my fingers as separate features! Oh, you've
given me a taste of it; it's your own fault, Captain Selwyn, and
now I desire more if you please&mdash;in semi-weekly lingering
doses&mdash;"</p>
<p>A perfect gale of laughter from the sofa cut her short.</p>
<p>"Drina!" she exclaimed; "it's after eight!&mdash;and I
completely forgot."</p>
<p>"Oh, dear!" protested the child, "he's being so funny about the
war in Samar. Couldn't I stay up&mdash;just five more minutes,
Eileen? Besides, I haven't told him about Jessie Orchil's
party&mdash;"</p>
<p>"Drina, dear, you <i>know</i> I can't let you. Say good-night,
now&mdash;if you want Mr. Lansing and your Uncle Philip to come to
another party."</p>
<p>"I'll just whisper one more confidence very fast," she said to
Boots. He inclined his head; she placed both hands on his
shoulders, and, kneeling on the sofa, laid her lips close to his
ear. Eileen and Selwyn waited.</p>
<p>When the child had ended and had taken leave of all, Boots also
took his leave; and Selwyn rose, too, a troubled, careworn
expression replacing the careless gaiety which had made him seem so
young in Miss Erroll's youthful eyes.</p>
<p>"Wait, Boots," he said; "I'm going home with you." And, to
Eileen, almost absently: "Good-night; I'm so very glad you are well
again."</p>
<p>"Good-night," she said, looking up at him. The faintest sense of
disappointment came over her&mdash;at what, she did not know. Was
it because, in his completely altered face she realised the instant
and easy detachment from herself, and what concerned her?&mdash;was
it because other people, like Mr. Lansing&mdash;other
interests&mdash;like those which so plainly, in his face, betrayed
his preoccupation&mdash;had so easily replaced an intimacy which
had seemed to grow newer and more delightful with every
meeting?</p>
<p>What was it, then, that he found more interesting, more
important, than their friendship, their companionship? Was she
never to grow old enough, or wise enough, or experienced enough to
exact&mdash;without exacting&mdash;his paramount consideration and
interest? Was there no common level of mental equality where they
could meet?&mdash;where termination of interviews might be
mutual&mdash;might be fairer to her?</p>
<p>Now he went away, utterly detached from her and what concerned
her&mdash;to seek other interests of which she knew nothing;
absorbed in them to her utter exclusion, leaving her here with the
long evening before her and nothing to do&mdash;because her eyes
were not yet strong enough to use for reading.</p>
<p>Lansing was saying: "I'll drive as far as the club with you, and
then you can drop me and come back later."</p>
<p>"Right, my son; I'll finish a letter and then come
back&mdash;"</p>
<p>"Can't you write it at the club?"</p>
<p>"Not that letter," he replied in a low voice; and, turning to
Eileen, smiled his absent, detached smile, offering his hand.</p>
<p>But she lay back, looking straight up at him.</p>
<p>"Are you going?"</p>
<p>"Yes; I have several&mdash;"</p>
<p>"Stay with me," she said in a low voice.</p>
<p>For a moment the words meant nothing; then blank surprise
silenced him, followed by curiosity.</p>
<p>"Is there something you wished to tell me?" he asked.</p>
<p>"N-no."</p>
<p>His perplexity and surprise grew. "Wait a second, Boots," he
said; and Mr. Lansing, being a fairly intelligent young man, went
out and down the stairway.</p>
<p>"Now," he said, too kindly, too soothingly, "what is it,
Eileen?"</p>
<p>"Nothing. I thought&mdash;but I don't care. Please go, Captain
Selwyn."</p>
<p>"No, I shall not until you tell me what troubles you."</p>
<p>"I can't."</p>
<p>"Try, Eileen."</p>
<p>"Why, it is nothing; truly it is nothing. . . . Only I
was&mdash;it is so early&mdash;only a quarter past
eight&mdash;"</p>
<p>He stood there looking down at her, striving to understand.</p>
<p>"That is all," she said, flushing a trifle; "I can't read and I
can't sew and there's nobody here. . . . I don't mean to bother
you&mdash;"</p>
<p>"Child," he exclaimed, "do you <i>want</i> me to stay?"</p>
<p>"Yes," she said; "will you?"</p>
<p>He walked swiftly to the landing outside and looked down.</p>
<p>"Boots!" he called in a low voice, "I'm not going home yet.
Don't wait for me at the Lenox."</p>
<p>"All right," returned Mr. Lansing cheerfully. A moment later the
front door closed below. Then Selwyn came back into the
library.</p>
<p>For an hour he sat there telling her the gayest stories and
talking the most delightful nonsense, alternating with interesting
incisions into serious subjects: which it enchanted her to dissect
under his confident guidance.</p>
<p>Alert, intelligent, all aquiver between laughter and absorption,
she had sat up among her silken pillows, resting her weight on one
rounded arm, her splendid young eyes fixed on him to detect and
follow and interpret every change in his expression personal to the
subject and to her share in it.</p>
<p>His old self again! What could be more welcome? Not one shadow
in his pleasant eyes, not a trace of pallor, of care, of that gray
aloofness. How jolly, how young he was after all!</p>
<p>They discussed, or laughed at, or mentioned and dismissed with a
gesture a thousand matters of common interest in that swift
hour&mdash;incredibly swift, unless the hall clock's deadened
chimes were mocking Time itself with mischievous effrontery.</p>
<p>She heard them, the enchantment still in her eyes; he nodded,
listening, meeting her gaze with his smile undisturbed. When the
last chime had sounded she lay back among her cushions.</p>
<p>"Thank you for staying," she said quite happily.</p>
<p>"Am I to go?"</p>
<p>Smilingly thoughtful she considered him from her pillows:</p>
<p>"Where were you going when I&mdash;spoiled it all? For you were
going somewhere&mdash;out there"&mdash;with a gesture toward the
darkness outside&mdash;"somewhere where men go to have the good
times they always seem to have. . . . Was it to your club? What do
men do there? Is it very gay at men's clubs? . . . It must be
interesting to go where men have such jolly times&mdash;where men
gather to talk that mysterious man-talk which we so often wonder
at&mdash;and pretend we are indifferent. But we are very curious,
nevertheless&mdash;even about the boys of Gerald's age&mdash;whom
we laugh at and torment; and we can't help wondering how they talk
to each other&mdash;what they say that is so interesting; for they
somehow manage to convey that impression to us&mdash;even against
our will. . . . If you stay, I shall never have done with
chattering. When you sit there with one lazy knee so leisurely
draped over the other, and your eyes laughing at me through your
cigar-smoke, about a million ideas flash up in me which I desire to
discuss with you. . . . So you had better go."</p>
<p>"I am happier here," he said, watching her.</p>
<p>"Really?"</p>
<p>"Really."</p>
<p>"Then&mdash;then&mdash;am <i>I</i>, also, one of the 'good
times' a man can have?&mdash;when he is at liberty to reflect and
choose as he idles over his coffee?"</p>
<p>"A man is fortunate if you permit that choice."</p>
<p>"Are you serious? I mean a man, not a boy&mdash;not a dance or
dinner partner, or one of the men one meets about&mdash;everywhere
from pillar to post. Do you think me interesting to real
men?&mdash;like you and Boots?"</p>
<p>"Yes," he said deliberately, "I do. I don't know how
interesting, because&mdash;I never quite realised how&mdash;how you
had matured. . . . That was my stupidity."</p>
<p>"Captain Selwyn!" in confused triumph; "you never gave me a
chance; I mean, you always were nice in&mdash;in the same way you
are to Drina. . . . I liked it&mdash;don't please
misunderstand&mdash;only I knew there was something else to
me&mdash;something more nearly your own age. It was jolly to know
you were really fond of me&mdash;but youthful sisters grow faster
than you imagine. . . . And now, when you come, I shall venture to
believe it is not wholly to do me a kindness&mdash;but&mdash;a
little&mdash;to do yourself one, too. Is that not the basis of
friendship?"</p>
<p>"Yes."</p>
<p>"Community and equality of interests?&mdash;isn't it?"</p>
<p>"Yes."</p>
<p>"&mdash;And&mdash;in which the&mdash;the charity of superior
experience and the inattention of intellectual preoccupation and
the amused concession to ignorance must steadily, if gradually,
disappear? Is that it, too?"</p>
<p>Astonishment and chagrin at his misconception of her gave place
to outright laughter at his own expense.</p>
<p>"Where on earth did you&mdash;I mean that I am quite overwhelmed
under your cutting indictment of me. Old duffers of my
age&mdash;"</p>
<p>"Don't say that," she said; "that is pleading guilty to the
indictment, and reverting to the old footing. I shall not permit
you to go back."</p>
<p>"I don't want to, Eileen&mdash;"</p>
<p>"I am wondering," she said airily, "about that 'Eileen.' I'm not
sure but that easy and fluent 'Eileen' is part of the indictment.
What do you call Gladys Orchil, for example?"</p>
<p>"What do I care what I call anybody?" he retorted, laughing, "as
long as they</p>
<div class='blockquot'>"'Answer to "Hi!"<br />
Or to any loud cry'?"</div>
<p>"But <i>I</i> won't answer to 'Hi!'" she retorted very promptly;
"and now that you admit that I am a 'good time,' a mature
individual with distinguishing characteristics, and your
intellectual equal if not your peer in experience, I'm not sure
that I shall answer at all whenever you begin 'Eileen.' Or I shall
take my time about it&mdash;or I may even reflect and look straight
through you before I reply&mdash;or," she added, "I may be so
profoundly preoccupied with important matters which do not concern
you, that I might not even hear you speak at all."</p>
<p>Their light-hearted laughter mingled delightfully&mdash;fresh,
free, uncontrolled, peal after peal. She sat huddled up like a
schoolgirl, lovely head thrown back, her white hands clasping her
knees; he, both feet squarely on the floor, leaned forward, his
laughter echoing hers.</p>
<p>"What nonsense! What blessed nonsense you and I are talking!"
she said, "but it has made me quite happy. Now you may go to your
club and your mysterious man-talk&mdash;"</p>
<p>"I don't want to&mdash;"</p>
<p>"Oh, but you must!"&mdash;<i>she</i> was now dismissing
<i>him</i>&mdash;"because, although I am convalescent, I am a
little tired, and Nina's maid is waiting to tuck me in."</p>
<p>"So you send me away?"</p>
<p>"<i>Send</i> you&mdash;" She hesitated, delightfully confused in
the reversal of roles&mdash;not quite convinced of this new power
which, of itself, had seemed to invest her with authority over man.
"Yes," she said, "I must send you away." And her heart beat a
little faster in her uncertainty as to his obedience&mdash;then
leaped in triumph as he rose with a reluctance perfectly
visible.</p>
<p>"To-morrow," she said, "I am to drive for the first time. In the
evening I may be permitted to go to the Grays' mid-Lent
dance&mdash;but not to dance much. Will you be there? Didn't they
ask you? I shall tell Suddy Gray what I think of him&mdash;I don't
care whether it's for the younger set or not! Goodness me, aren't
you as young as anybody! . . . Well, then! . . . So we won't see
each other to-morrow. And the day after that&mdash;oh, I wish I had
my engagement list. Never mind, I will telephone you when I'm to be
at home&mdash;or wherever I'm going to be. But it won't be anywhere
in particular because it's Lent, of course. . . . Good-night,
Captain Selwyn; you've been very sweet to me, and I've enjoyed
every single instant."</p>
<p>When he had gone she rose, a trifle excited in the glow of
abstract happiness, and walked erratically about, smiling to
herself, touching and rearranging objects that caught her
attention. Then an innocent instinct led her to the mirror, where
she stood a moment looking back into the lovely reflected face with
its disordered hair.</p>
<p>"After all," she said, "I'm not as aged as I pretended. . . . I
wonder if he is laughing at me now. . . . But he was very, very
nice to me&mdash;wherever he has gone in quest of that 'good time'
and to talk his man-talk to other men&mdash;"</p>
<p>In a reverie she stood at the mirror considering her own flushed
cheeks and brilliant eyes.</p>
<p>"What a curiously interesting man he is," she murmured
na&iuml;vely. "I shall telephone him that I am not going to that
<i>mi-car&ecirc;me</i> dance. . . . Besides, Suddy Gray is a bore
with the martyred smile he's been cultivating. . . . As though a
happy girl would dream of marrying anybody with all life before her
to learn important things in! . . . And that dreadful, downy Scott
Innis&mdash;trying to make me listen to <i>him</i>! . . . until I
was ashamed to be alive! And Bradley Harmon&mdash;ugh!&mdash;and
oh, that mushy widower, Percy Draymore, who got hold of my arm
before I dreamed&mdash;"</p>
<p>She shuddered and turned back into the room, frowning and
counting her slow steps across the floor.</p>
<p>"After all," she said, "their silliness may be their greatest
mystery&mdash;but I don't include Captain Selwyn," she added
loyally; "he is far too intelligent to be like other men."</p>
<hr style='width: 45%;' />
<p>Yet, like other men, at that very moment Captain Selwyn was
playing the fizzing contents of a siphon upon the iced ingredients
of a tall, thin glass which stood on a table in the Lenox Club.</p>
<p>The governor's room being deserted except by himself and Mr.
Lansing, he continued the animated explanation of his delay in
arriving.</p>
<p>"So I stayed," he said to Boots with an enthusiasm quite boyish,
"and I had a perfectly bully time. She's just as clever as she can
be&mdash;startling at moments. I never half appreciated
her&mdash;she formerly appealed to me in a different way&mdash;a
young girl knocking at the door of the world, and no mother or
father to open for her and show her the gimcracks and the freaks
and the side-shows. Do you know, Boots, that some day that girl is
going to marry somebody, and it worries me, knowing men as I
do&mdash;unless you should think of&mdash;"</p>
<p>"Great James!" faltered Mr. Lansing, "are you turning into a
schatschen? Are you planning to waddle through the world making
matches for your friends? If you are I'm quitting you right
here."</p>
<p>"It's only because you are the decentest man I happen to know,"
said Selwyn resentfully. "Probably she'd turn you down, anyway.
But&mdash;" and he brightened up, "I dare say she'll choose the
best to be had; it's a pity though&mdash;"</p>
<p>"What's a pity?"</p>
<p>"That a charming, intellectual, sensitive, innocent girl like
that should be turned over to a plain lump of a man."</p>
<p>"When you've finished your eulogy on our sex," said Lansing,
"I'll walk home with you."</p>
<p>"Come on, then; I can talk while I walk; did you think I
couldn't?"</p>
<p>And as they struck through the first cross street toward
Lexington Avenue: "It's a privilege for a fellow to know that sort
of a girl&mdash;so many surprises in her&mdash;the charmingly
unexpected and unsuspected!&mdash;the pretty flashes of wit, the
na&iuml;ve egotism which is as amusing as it is harmless. . . . I
had no idea how complex she is. . . . If you think you have the
simple feminine on your hands&mdash;forget it, Boots!&mdash;for
she's as evanescent as a helio-flash and as stunningly luminous as
a searchlight. . . . And here I've been doing the benevolent prig,
bestowing society upon her as a man doles out indigestible stuff to
a kid, using a sort of guilty discrimination in the
distribution&mdash;"</p>
<p>"What on earth is all this?" demanded Lansing; "are you perhaps
<i>non compos</i>, dear friend?"</p>
<p>"I'm trying to tell you and explain to myself that little Miss
Erroll is a rare and profoundly interesting specimen of a genus not
usually too amusing," he replied with growing enthusiasm. "Of
course, Holly Erroll was her father, and that accounts for
something; and her mother seems to have been a wit as well as a
beauty&mdash;which helps you to understand; but the brilliancy of
the result&mdash;aged nineteen, mind you&mdash;is out of all
proportion; cause and effect do not balance. . . . Why, Boots, an
ordinary man&mdash;I mean an everyday fellow who dines and dances
and does the harmlessly usual about town, dwindles to an&aelig;mic
insignificance when compared to that young girl&mdash;even now when
she's practically undeveloped&mdash;when her intelligence is like
an uncut gem still in the matrix of inexperience&mdash;"</p>
<p>"Help!" said Boots feebly, attempting to bolt; but Selwyn hooked
arms with him, laughing excitedly. In fact Lansing had not seen his
friend in such excellent spirits for many, many months; and it made
him exceedingly light-hearted, so that he presently began to chant
the old service canticle:</p>
<div class='blockquot'>"I have another, he's just as bad,<br />
He almost drives me crazy&mdash;"</div>
<p>And arm in arm they swung into the dark avenue, singing "Barney
Riley" in resonant undertones, while overhead the chilly little
Western stars looked down through pallid convolutions of moving
clouds, and the wind in the gas-lit avenue grew keener on the
street-corners.</p>
<p>"Cooler followed by clearing," observed Boots in disgust. "Ugh;
it's the limit, this nipping, howling hemisphere." And he turned up
his overcoat collar.</p>
<p>"I prefer it to a hemisphere that smells like a cheap
joss-stick," said Selwyn.</p>
<p>"After all, they're about alike," retorted Boots&mdash;"even to
the ladrones of Broad Street and the dattos of Wall. . . . And
here's our bally bungalow now," he added, fumbling for his keys and
whistling "taps" under his breath.</p>
<p>As the two men entered and started to ascend the stairs, a door
on the parlour floor opened and their landlady appeared, enveloped
in a soiled crimson kimona and a false front which had slipped
sideways.</p>
<p>"There's the Sultana," whispered Lansing, "and she's making
sign-language at you. Wig-wag her, Phil. Oh . . . good-evening,
Mrs. Greeve; did you wish to speak to me? Oh!&mdash;to Captain
Selwyn. Of course."</p>
<p>"If <i>you</i> please," said Mrs. Greeve ominously, so Lansing
continued upward; Selwyn descended; Mrs. Greeve waved him into the
icy parlour, where he presently found her straightening her "front"
with work-worn fingers.</p>
<p>"Captain Selwyn, I deemed it my duty to set up in order to
inform you of certain special doin's," she said haughtily.</p>
<p>"What 'doings'?" he inquired.</p>
<p>"Mr. Erroll's, sir. Last night he evidentially found difficulty
with the stairs and I seen him asleep on the parlour sofa when I
come down to answer the milkman, a-smokin' a cigar that wasn't lit,
with his feet on the angelus."</p>
<p>"I'm very, very sorry, Mrs. Greeve," he said&mdash;"and so is
Mr. Erroll. He and I had a little talk to-day, and I am sure that
he will be more careful hereafter."</p>
<p>"There is cigar-holes burned into the carpet," insisted Mrs.
Greeve, "and a mercy we wasn't all insinuated in our beds, one
window-pane broken and the gas a blue an' whistlin' streak with the
curtains blowin' into it an' a strange cat on to that satin
dozy-do; the proof being the repugnant perfume."</p>
<p>"All of which," said Selwyn, "Mr. Erroll will make every
possible amends for. He is very young, Mrs. Greeve, and very much
ashamed, I am sure. So please don't make it too hard for him."</p>
<p>She stood, little slippered feet planted sturdily in the first
position in dancing, fat, bare arms protruding from the kimona, her
work-stained fingers linked together in front of her. With a soiled
thumb she turned a ring on her third finger.</p>
<p>"I ain't a-goin' to be mean to nobody," she said; "my gentlemen
is always refined, even if they do sometimes forget theirselves
when young and sporty. Mr. Erroll is now a-bed, sir, and asleep
like a cherub, ice havin' been served three times with towels,
extra. Would you be good enough to mention the bill to him in the
morning?&mdash;the grocer bein' sniffy." And she handed the wadded
and inky memorandum of damages to Selwyn, who pocketed it with a
nod of assurance.</p>
<p>"There was," she added, following him to the door, "a lady here
to see you twice, leavin' no name or intentions otherwise than
business affairs of a pressin' nature."</p>
<p>"A&mdash;lady?" he repeated, halting short on the stairs.</p>
<p>"Young an' refined, allowin' for a automobile veil."</p>
<p>"She&mdash;she asked for me?" he repeated, astonished.</p>
<p>"Yes, sir. She wanted to see your rooms. But havin' no orders,
Captain Selwyn&mdash;although I must say she was that polite and
ladylike and," added Mrs. Greeve irrelevantly, "a art rocker come
for you, too, and another for Mr. Lansing, which I placed in your
respective settin'-rooms."</p>
<p>"Oh," said Selwyn, laughing in relief, "it's all right, Mrs.
Greeve. The lady who came is my sister, Mrs. Gerard; and whenever
she comes you are to admit her whether or not I am here."</p>
<p>"She said she might come again," nodded Mrs. Greeve as he
mounted the stairs; "am I to show her up any time she comes?"</p>
<p>"Certainly&mdash;thank you," he called back&mdash;"and Mr.
Gerard, too, if he calls."</p>
<p>He looked into Boots's room as he passed; that gentleman, in
bedroom costume of peculiar exotic gorgeousness, sat stuffing a
pipe with shag, and poring over a mass of papers pertaining to the
Westchester Air Line's property and prospective developments.</p>
<p>"Come in, Phil," he called out; "and look at the dinky chair
somebody sent me!" But Selwyn shook his head.</p>
<p>"Come into my rooms when you're ready," he said, and closed the
door again, smiling and turning away toward his own quarters.</p>
<p>Before he entered, however, he walked the length of the hall and
cautiously tried the handle of Gerald's door. It yielded; he
lighted a match and gazed at the sleeping boy where he lay very
peacefully among his pillows. Then, without a sound, he reclosed
the door and withdrew to his apartment.</p>
<p>As he emerged from the bedroom in his dressing-gown he heard the
front door-bell below peal twice, but paid no heed, his attention
being concentrated on the chair which Nina had sent him. First he
walked gingerly all around it, then he ventured nearer to examine
it in detail, and presently he tried it.</p>
<p>"Of course," he sighed&mdash;"bless her heart!&mdash;it's a
perfectly impossible chair. It squeaks, too." But he was mistaken;
the creak came from the old stairway outside his door, weighted
with the tread of Mrs. Greeve. The tread and the creaking ceased;
there came a knock, then heavy descending footsteps on the aged
stairway, every separate step protesting until the incubus had sunk
once more into the depths from which it had emerged.</p>
<p>As this happened to be the night for his laundry, he merely
called out, "All right!" and remained incurious, seated in the new
chair and striving to adjust its stiff and narrow architecture to
his own broad shoulders. Finally he got up and filled his pipe,
intending to try the chair once more under the most favourable
circumstances.</p>
<p>As he lighted his pipe there came a hesitating knock at the
door; he jerked his head sharply; the knock was repeated.</p>
<p>Something&mdash;a faintest premonition&mdash;the vaguest
stirring of foreboding committed him to silence&mdash;and left him
there motionless. The match burned close to his fingers; he dropped
it and set his heel upon the sparks.</p>
<p>Then he walked swiftly to the door, flung it open full
width&mdash;and stood stock still.</p>
<p>And Mrs. Ruthven entered the room, partly closing the door
behind, her gloved hand still resting on the knob.</p>
<p>For a moment they confronted one another, he tall, rigid,
astounded; she pale, supple, relaxing a trifle against the
half-closed door behind her, which yielded and closed with a low
click.</p>
<p>At the sound of the closing door he found his voice; it did not
resemble his own voice either to himself or to her; but she
answered his bewildered question:</p>
<p>"I don't know why I came. Is it so very dreadful? Have I
offended you? . . . I did not suppose that men cared about
conventions."</p>
<p>"But&mdash;why on earth&mdash;did you come?" he repeated. "Are
you in trouble?"</p>
<p>"I seem to be now," she said with a tremulous laugh; "you are
frightening me to death, Captain Selwyn."</p>
<p>Still dazed, he found the first chair at hand and dragged it
toward her.</p>
<p>She hesitated at the offer; then: "Thank you," she said, passing
before him. She laid her hand on the chair, looked a moment at him,
and sank into it.</p>
<p>Resting there, her pale cheek against her muff, she smiled at
him, and every nerve in him quivered with pity.</p>
<p>"World without end; amen," she said. "Let the judgment of man
pass."</p>
<p>"The judgment of this man passes very gently," he said, looking
down at her. "What brings you here, Mrs. Ruthven?"</p>
<p>"Will you believe me?"</p>
<p>"Yes."</p>
<p>"Then&mdash;it is simply the desire of the friendless for a
friend. Nothing else&mdash;nothing more subtle, nothing of
effrontery; n-nothing worse. Do you believe me?"</p>
<p>"I don't understand&mdash;"</p>
<p>"Try to."</p>
<p>"Do you mean that you have differed with&mdash;"</p>
<p>"Him?" She laughed. "Oh, no; I was talking of real people, not
of myths. And real people are not very friendly to me,
always&mdash;not that they are disagreeable, you understand, only a
trifle overcordial; and my most intimate friend kisses me a little
too frequently. By the way, she has quite succumbed to you, I
hear."</p>
<p>"Who do you mean?"</p>
<p>"Why, Rosamund."</p>
<p>He said something under his breath and looked at her
impatiently.</p>
<p>"Didn't you know it?" she asked, smiling.</p>
<p>"Know what?"</p>
<p>"That Rosamund is quite crazy about you?"</p>
<p>"Good Lord! Do you suppose that any of the monkey set are
interested in me or I in them?" he said, disgusted. "Do I ever go
near them or meet them at all except by accident in the routine of
the machinery which sometimes sews us in tangent patches on this
crazy-quilt called society?"</p>
<div class="figcenter"><a href=
"images/facing_page154.jpg"><img src="images/facing_page154.jpg"
width="45%" alt="" title="" /></a><br />
<b>"'I don't know why I came.'"</b>
<br /></div>
<p>"But Rosamund," she said, laughing, "is now cultivating Mrs.
Gerard."</p>
<p>"What of it?" he demanded.</p>
<p>"Because," she replied, still laughing, "I tell you, she is
perfectly mad about you. There's no use scowling and squaring your
chin. Oh, I ought to know what that indicates! I've watched you do
it often enough; but the fact is that the handsomest and smartest
woman in town is for ever dinning your perfections into my
ears&mdash;"</p>
<p>"I know," he said, "that this sort of stuff passes in your set
for wit; but let me tell you that any man who cares for that brand
of humour can have it any time he chooses. However, he goes outside
the residence district to find it."</p>
<p>She flushed scarlet at his brutality; he drew up a chair, seated
himself very deliberately, and spoke, his unlighted pipe in his
left hand:</p>
<p>"The girl I left&mdash;the girl who left me&mdash;was a modest,
clean-thinking, clean-minded girl, who also had a brain to use, and
employed it. Whatever conclusion that girl arrived at concerning
the importance of marriage-vows is no longer my business; but the
moment she confronts me again, offering friendship, then I may use
a friend's privilege, as I do. And so I tell you that loosely
fashionable badinage bores me. And another matter&mdash;privileged
by the friendship you acknowledge&mdash;forces me to ask you a
question, and I ask it, point-blank: Why have you again permitted
Gerald to play cards for stakes at your house, after promising you
would not do so?"</p>
<p>The colour receded from her face and her gloved fingers
tightened on the arms of her chair.</p>
<p>"That is one reason I came," she said; "to explain&mdash;"</p>
<p>"You could have written."</p>
<p>"I say it was <i>one</i> reason; the other I have already given
you&mdash;because I&mdash;I felt that you were friendly."</p>
<p>"I am. Go on."</p>
<p>"I don't know whether you are friendly to me; I thought you
were&mdash;that night. . . . I did not sleep a wink after it . . .
because I was quite happy. . . . But now&mdash;I don't
know&mdash;"</p>
<p>"Whether I am still friendly? Well, I am. So please explain
about Gerald."</p>
<p>"Are you sure?" raising her dark eyes, "that you mean to be
kind?"</p>
<p>"Yes, sure," he said harshly. "Go on."</p>
<p>"You are a little rough with me; a-almost insolent&mdash;"</p>
<p>"I&mdash;I have to be. Good God! Alixe, do you think this is
nothing to me?&mdash;this wretched mess we have made of life! Do
you think my roughness and abruptness comes from anything but
pity?&mdash;pity for us both, I tell you. Do you think I can remain
unmoved looking on the atrocious punishment you have inflicted on
yourself?&mdash;tethered to&mdash;to <i>that</i>!&mdash;for
life!&mdash;the poison of the contact showing in your altered voice
and manner!&mdash;in the things you laugh at, in the things you
live for&mdash;in the twisted, misshapen ideals that your friends
set up on a heap of nuggets for you to worship? Even if we've
passed through the sea of mire, can't we at least clear the filth
from our eyes and see straight and steer straight to the
anchorage?"</p>
<p>She had covered her pallid face with her muff; he bent forward,
his hand on the arm of her chair.</p>
<p>"Alixe, was there nothing to you, after all? Was it only a
tinted ghost that was blown into my bungalow that night&mdash;only
a twist of shredded marsh mist without substance, without being,
without soul?&mdash;to be blown away into the shadows with the next
and stronger wind&mdash;and again to drift out across the waste
places of the world? I thought I knew a sweet, impulsive comrade of
flesh and blood; warm, quick, generous, intelligent&mdash;and very,
very young&mdash;too young and spirited, perhaps, to endure the
harness which coupled her with a man who failed her&mdash;and
failed himself.</p>
<p>"That she has made another&mdash;and perhaps more heart-breaking
mistake, is bitter for me, too&mdash;because&mdash;because&mdash;I
have not yet forgotten. And even if I ceased to remember, the
sadness of it must touch me. But I have not forgotten, and because
I have not, I say to you, anchor! and hold fast. Whatever <i>he</i>
does, whatever you suffer, whatever happens, steer straight on to
the anchorage. Do you understand me?"</p>
<p>Her gloved hand, moving at random, encountered his and closed on
it convulsively.</p>
<p>"Do you understand?" he repeated.</p>
<p>"Y-es, Phil."</p>
<p>Head still sinking, face covered with the silvery fur, the
tremors from her body set her hand quivering on his.</p>
<p>Heart-sick, he forbore to ask for the explanation; he knew the
real answer, anyway&mdash;whatever she might say&mdash;and he
understood that any game in that house was Ruthven's game, and the
guests his guests; and that Gerald was only one of the younger men
who had been wrung dry in that house.</p>
<p>No doubt at all that Ruthven needed the money; he was only a
male geisha for the set that harboured him, anyway&mdash;picked up
by a big, hard-eyed woman, who had almost forgotten how to laugh,
until she found him furtively muzzling her diamond-laden fingers.
So, when she discovered that he could sit up and beg and roll over
at a nod, she let him follow her; and since then he had become
indispensable and had curled up on many a soft and silken knee, and
had sought and fetched and carried for many a pretty woman what she
herself did not care to touch, even with white-gloved fingers.</p>
<p>What had she expected when she married him? Only innocent
ignorance of the set he ornamented could account for the horror of
her disillusion. What splendours had she dreamed of from the
outside? What flashing and infernal signal had beckoned her to
enter? What mute eyes had promised? What silent smile invited? All
skulls seem to grin; but the world has yet to hear them laugh.</p>
<hr style='width: 45%;' />
<p>"Philip?"</p>
<p>"Yes, Alixe."</p>
<p>"I did my best, w-without offending Gerald. Can you believe
me?"</p>
<p>"I know you did. . . . Don't mind what I said&mdash;"</p>
<p>"N-no, not now. . . . You do believe me, don't you?"</p>
<p>"Yes, I do."</p>
<p>"Thank you. . . . And, Phil, I will try to s-steer
straight&mdash;because you ask me."</p>
<p>"You must."</p>
<p>"I will. . . . It is good to be here. . . . I must not come
again, must I?"</p>
<p>"Not again, Alixe."</p>
<p>"On your account?"</p>
<p>"On your own. . . . What do <i>I</i> care?"</p>
<p>"I didn't know. They say&mdash;"</p>
<p>"What?" he asked sharply.</p>
<p>"A rumour&mdash;I heard it&mdash;others speak of
it&mdash;perhaps to be disagreeable to me&mdash;"</p>
<p>"What have you heard?"</p>
<p>"That&mdash;that you might marry again&mdash;"</p>
<p>"Well, you can nail that lie," he said hotly.</p>
<p>"Then it is not true?"</p>
<p>"True! Do you think I'd take that chance again even if I felt
free to do it?"</p>
<p>"Free?" she faltered; "but you <i>are</i> free, Phil!"</p>
<p>"I am not," he said fiercely; "no man is free to marry twice
under such conditions. It's a jest at decency and a slap in the
face of civilisation! I'm done for&mdash;finished; I had my chance
and I failed. Do you think I consider myself free to try again with
the chance of further bespattering my family?"</p>
<p>"Wait until you really love," she said tremulously.</p>
<p>He laughed incredulously.</p>
<p>"I am glad that it is not true. . . . I am glad," she said. "Oh,
Phil! Phil!&mdash;for a single one of the chances we had again and
again and again!&mdash;and we did not know&mdash;we did not know!
And yet&mdash;there were moments&mdash;"</p>
<p>Dry-lipped he looked at her, and dry of eye and lip she raised
her head and stared at him&mdash;through him&mdash;far beyond at
the twin ghosts floating under the tropic stars locked fast in
their first embrace.</p>
<p>Then she rose, blindly, covering her face with her hands, and he
stumbled to his feet, shrinking back from her&mdash;because dead
fires were flickering again, and the ashes of dead roses stirred
above the scented embers&mdash;and the magic of all the East was
descending like a veil upon them, and the Phantom of the Past drew
nearer, smiling, wide-armed, crowned with living blossoms.</p>
<p>The tide rose, swaying her where she stood; her hands fell from
her face. Between them the grave they had dug seemed almost filled
with flowers now&mdash;was filling fast. And across it they looked
at one another as though stunned. Then his face paled and he
stepped back, staring at her from stern eyes.</p>
<p>"Phil," she faltered, bewildered by the mirage, "is it only a
bad dream, after all?" And as the false magic glowed into blinding
splendour to engulf them: "Oh, boy! boy!&mdash;is it hell or heaven
where we've fallen&mdash;?"</p>
<p>There came a loud rapping at the door.</p>
<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_V" id="CHAPTER_V"></a>CHAPTER V</h2>
<h3>AFTERGLOW</h3>
<p>"Phil," she wrote, "I am a little frightened. Do you suppose
Boots suspected who it was? I must have been perfectly mad to go to
your rooms that night; and we both were&mdash;to leave the door
unlocked with the chance of somebody walking in. But, Phil, how
could I know it was the fashion for your friends to bang like that
and then come in without the excuse of a response from you?</p>
<p>"I have been so worried, so anxious, hoping from day to day that
you would write to reassure me that Boots did not recognise me with
my back turned to him and my muff across my eyes.</p>
<p>"But scared and humiliated as I am I realise that it was well
that he knocked. Even as I write to you here in my own room, behind
locked doors, I am burning with the shame of it.</p>
<p>"But I am <i>not</i> that kind of woman, Phil; truly, truly, I
am not. When the foolish impulse seized me I had no clear idea of
what I wanted except to see you and learn for myself what you
thought about Gerald's playing at my house after I had promised not
to let him.</p>
<p>"Of course, I understood what I risked in going; I realised what
common interpretation might be put upon what I was doing. But ugly
as it might appear to anybody except you, my motive, you see, must
have been quite innocent&mdash;else I should have gone about it in
a very different manner.</p>
<p>"I wanted to see you, that is absolutely all; I was lonely for a
word&mdash;even a harsh one&mdash;from the sort of man you are. I
wanted you to believe it was in spite of me that Gerald came and
played that night.</p>
<p>"He came without my knowledge. I did not know he was invited.
And when he appeared I did everything to prevent him from playing;
<i>you</i> will never know what took place&mdash;what I submitted
to&mdash;</p>
<p>"I am trying to be truthful, Phil; I want to lay my heart bare
for you&mdash;but there are things a woman cannot wholly confess.
Believe me, I did what I could. . . . And <i>that</i> is all I can
say. Oh, I know what it costs you to be mixed up in such
contemptible complications. I, for my part, can scarcely bear to
have you know so much about me&mdash;and what I am come to. That is
my real punishment, Phil&mdash;not what you said it was.</p>
<p>"I do not think it is well for me that you know so much about
me. It is not too difficult to face the outer world with a bold
front&mdash;or to deceive any man in it. But our own little world
is being rapidly undeceived; and now the only real man remaining in
it has seen my gay mask stripped off&mdash;which is not well for a
woman, Phil.</p>
<p>"I remember what you said about an anchorage; I am trying to
clear these haunted eyes of mine and steer clear of
phantoms&mdash;for the honour of what we once were to each other
before the world. But steering a ghost-ship through endless
tempests is hard labour, Phil; so be a little kind&mdash;a little
more than patient, if my hand grows tired at the wheel.</p>
<p>"And now&mdash;with all these madly inked pages scattered across
my desk, I draw toward me another sheet&mdash;the last I have still
unstained; to ask at last the question which I have shrunk from
through all these pages&mdash;and for which these pages alone were
written:</p>
<div class="blockquot">
<p>"<i>What</i> do you think of me? Asking you, shows how much I
care; dread of your opinion has turned me coward until this last
page. <i>What</i> do you think of me? I am perfectly miserable
about Boots, but that is partly fright&mdash;though I know I am
safe enough with such a man. But what sets my cheeks blazing so
that I cannot bear to face my own eyes in the mirror, is the fear
of what <i>you</i> must think of me in the still, secret places of
that heart of yours, which I never, never understood. ALIXE."</p>
</div>
<p>It was a week before he sent his reply&mdash;although he wrote
many answers, each in turn revised, corrected, copied, and
recopied, only to be destroyed in the end. But at last he forced
himself to meet truth with truth, cutting what crudity he could
from his letter:</p>
<div class="blockquot">
<p>"You ask me what I think of you; but that question should
properly come from me. What do <i>you</i> think of a man who
exhorts and warns a woman to stand fast, and then stands dumb at
the first impact of temptation?</p>
<p>"A sight for gods and men&mdash;that man! Is there any use for
me to stammer out trite phrases of self-contempt? The fact remains
that I am unfit to advise, criticise, or condemn anybody for
anything; and it's high time I realised it.</p>
<p>"If words of commendation, of courage, of kindly counsel, are
needed by anybody in this world, I am not the man to utter them.
What a hypocrite must I seem to you! I who sat there beside you
preaching platitudes in strong self-complacency, instructing you
how morally edifying it is to be good and unhappy.</p>
<p>"Then, what happened? I don't know exactly; but I'm trying to be
honest, and I'll tell you what I think happened:</p>
<p>"You are&mdash;you; I am&mdash;I; and we are still those same
two people who understood neither the impulse that once swept us
together, nor the forces that tore us apart&mdash;ah, more than
that! we never understood each other! And we do not now.</p>
<p>"That is what happened. We were too near together again; the
same spark leaped, the same blindness struck us, the same impulse
swayed us&mdash;call it what we will!&mdash;and it quickened out of
chaos, grew from nothing into unreasoning existence. It was the
terrific menace of emotion, stunning us both&mdash;simply because
you are you and I am I. And that is what happened.</p>
<p>"We cannot deny it; we may not have believed it
possible&mdash;or in fact considered it at all. I did not; I am
sure you did not. Yet it occurred, and we cannot deny it, and we
can no more explain or understand it than we can understand each
other.</p>
<p>"But one thing we do know&mdash;not through reason but through
sheer instinct: We cannot venture to meet again&mdash;that way. For
I, it seems, am a man like other men except that I lack character;
and you are&mdash;<i>you</i>! still unchanged&mdash;with all the
mystery of attraction, all the magic force of vitality, all the
esoteric subtlety with which you enveloped me the first moment my
eyes met yours.</p>
<p>"There was no more reason for it then than there is now; and, as
you admit, it was not love&mdash;though, as you also admit, there
were moments approaching it. But nothing can have real being
without a basis of reason; and so, whatever it was, it vanished.
This, perhaps, is only the infernal afterglow.</p>
<p>"As for me, I am, as you are, all at sea, self-confidence gone,
self-faith lost&mdash;a very humble person, without conceit, dazed,
perplexed, but still attempting to steer through toward that safe
anchorage which I dared lately to recommend to you.</p>
<p>"And it is really there, Alixe, despite the fool who recites his
creed so tritely.</p>
<p>"All this in attempt to bring order into my own mental
confusion; and the result is that I have formulated nothing.</p>
<p>"So now I end where I began with that question which answers
yours without the faintest suspicion of reproach: What can you
think of such a man as I am? And in the presence of my
<i>second</i> failure your answer must be that you now think what
you once thought of him when you first realised that he had failed
you, PHILIP SELWYN."</p>
</div>
<p>That very night brought him her reply:</p>
<div class="blockquot">
<p>"Phil, dear, I do not blame you for one instant. Why do you say
you ever failed in anything? It was entirely my fault. But I am so
happy that you wrote as you did, taking all the blame, which is
like you. I can look into my mirror now&mdash;for a moment or
two.</p>
<p>"It is brave of you to be so frank about what you think came
over us. I can discuss nothing, admit nothing; but you always did
reason more clearly than I. Still, whatever spell it was that
menaced us I know very well could not have threatened you
seriously; I know it because you reason about it so logically. So
it could have been nothing serious. Love alone is serious; and it
sometimes comes slowly, sometimes goes slowly; but if you desire it
to come quickly, close your eves! And if you wish it to vanish,
<i>reason about it</i>!</p>
<p>"We are on very safe ground again, Phil; you see we are making
little epigrams about love.</p>
<p>"Rosamund is impatient&mdash;it's a symphony concert, and I must
go&mdash;the horrid little cynic!&mdash;I half believe she suspects
that I'm writing to you and tearing off yards of sentiment. It is
likely I'd do that, isn't it!&mdash;but I don't care what she
thinks. Besides, it behooves her to be agreeable, and she knows
that I know it does! <i>Voil&agrave;</i>!</p>
<p>"By the way, I saw Mrs. Gerard's pretty ward at the theatre last
night&mdash;Miss Erroll. She certainly is stunning&mdash;"</p>
</div>
<p>Selwyn flattened out the letter and deliberately tore out the
last paragraph. Then he set it afire with a match.</p>
<p>"At least," he said with an ugly look, "I can keep <i>her</i>
out of this"; and he dropped the brittle blackened paper and set
his heel on it. Then he resumed his perusal of the mutilated
letter, reread it, and finally destroyed it.</p>
<div class="blockquot">
<p>"Alixe," he wrote in reply, "we had better stop this
letter-writing before somebody stops us. Anybody desiring to make
mischief might very easily misinterpret what we are doing. I, of
course, could not close the correspondence, so I ask you to do so
without any fear that you will fail to understand why I ask it.
Will you?"</p>
</div>
<p>To which she replied:</p>
<div class="blockquot">
<p>"Yes, Phil. Good-bye.</p>
<p>"ALIXE."</p>
</div>
<p>A box of roses left her his debtor; she was too intelligent to
acknowledge them. Besides, matters were going better with her.</p>
<p>And that was all for a while.</p>
<p>Meanwhile Lent had gone, and with it the last soiled snow of
winter. It was an unusually early spring; tulips in Union Square
appeared coincident with crocus and snow-drop; high above the
city's haze wavering wedges of wild-fowl drifted toward the
Canadas; a golden perfumed bloom clotted the naked branches of the
park shrubs; Japanese quince burst into crimson splendour; tender
chestnut leaves unfolded; the willows along the Fifty-ninth Street
wall waved banners of gilded green; and through the sunshine
battered butterflies floated, and the wild bees reappeared,
scrambling frantically, powdered to the thighs in the pollen of a
million dandelions.</p>
<div class='blockquot'>"Spring, with that nameless fragrance in the
air<br />
Which breathes of all things fair,"</div>
<p>sang a young girl riding in the Park. And she smiled to herself
as she guided her mare through the flowering labyrinths. Other
notes of the Southern poet's haunting song stole soundless from her
lips; for it was only her heart that was singing there in the sun,
while her silent, smiling mouth mocked the rushing melody of the
birds.</p>
<p>Behind her, powerfully mounted, ambled the belted groom; she was
riding alone in the golden weather because her good friend Selwyn
was very busy in his office downtown, and Gerald, who now rode with
her occasionally, was downtown also, and there remained nobody else
to ride with. Also the horses were to be sent to Silverside soon,
and she wanted to use them as much as possible while the Park was
at its loveliest.</p>
<p>She, therefore, galloped conscientiously every morning,
sometimes with Nina, but usually alone. And every afternoon she and
Nina drove there, drinking the freshness of the young
year&mdash;the most beautiful year of her life, she told herself,
in all the exquisite maturity of her adolescence.</p>
<p>So she rode on, straight before her, head high, the sun striking
face and firm, white throat; and in her heart laughed spring
eternal, whose voiceless melody parted her lips.</p>
<p>Breezes blowing from beds of iris quickened her breath with
their perfume; she saw the tufted lilacs sway in the wind, and the
streamers of mauve-tinted wistaria swinging, all a-glisten with
golden bees; she saw a crimson cardinal winging through the
foliage, and amorous tanagers flashing like scarlet flames athwart
the pines.</p>
<p>From rock and bridge and mouldy archway tender tendrils of
living green fluttered, brushing her cheeks. Beneath the thickets
the under-wood world was very busy, where squirrels squatted or
prowled and cunning fox-sparrows avoided the starlings and
blackbirds; and the big cinnamon-tinted, speckle-breasted thrashers
scuffled among last year's leaves or, balanced on some leafy spray,
carolled ecstatically of this earthly paradise.</p>
<p>It was near Eighty-sixth Street that a girl, splendidly mounted,
saluted her, and wheeling, joined her&mdash;a blond, cool-skinned,
rosy-tinted, smoothly groomed girl, almost too perfectly seated,
almost too flawless and supple in the perfect symmetry of face and
figure.</p>
<p>"Upon my word," she said gaily, "you are certainly spring
incarnate, Miss Erroll&mdash;the living embodiment of all this!"
She swung her riding-crop in a circle and laughed, showing her
perfect teeth. "But where is that faithful attendant cavalier of
yours this morning? Is he so grossly material that he prefers Wall
Street, as does my good lord and master?"</p>
<p>"Do you mean Gerald?" asked Eileen innocently, "or Captain
Selwyn?"</p>
<p>"Oh, either," returned Rosamund airily; "a girl should have
something masculine to talk to on a morning like this. Failing that
she should have some pleasant memories of indiscretions past and
others to come, D.V.; at least one little souvenir to
repent&mdash;smilingly. Oh, la! Oh, me! All these wretched birds
a-courting and I bumping along on Dobbin, lacking even my own
Gilpin! Shall we gallop?"</p>
<p>Eileen nodded.</p>
<p>When at length they pulled up along the reservoir, Eileen's hair
had rebelled as usual and one bright strand eurled like a circle of
ruddy light across her cheek; but Rosamund drew bridle as
immaculate as ever and coolly inspected her companion.</p>
<p>"What gorgeous hair," she said, staring. "It's worth a coronet,
you know&mdash;if you ever desire one."</p>
<p>"I don't," said the girl, laughing and attempting to bring the
insurgent curl under discipline.</p>
<p>"I dare say you're right; coronets are out of vogue among us
now. It's the fashion to marry our own good people. By the way, you
are continuing to astonish the town, I hear."</p>
<p>"What do you mean, Mrs. Fane?"</p>
<p>"Why, first it was Sudbury, then Draymore, and how everybody
says that Boots&mdash;"</p>
<p>"Boots!" repeated Miss Erroll blankly, then laughed
deliciously.</p>
<p>"Poor, poor Boots! Did they say <i>that</i> about him? Oh, it
really is too bad, Mrs. Fane; it is certainly horridly impertinent
of people to say such things. My only consolation is that Boots
won't care; and if he doesn't, why should I?"</p>
<p>Rosamund nodded, crossing her crop.</p>
<p>"At first, though, I did care," continued the girl. "I was so
ashamed that people should gossip whenever a man was trying to be
nice to me&mdash;"</p>
<p>"Pooh! It's always the men's own faults. Don't you suppose the
martyr's silence is noisier than a shriek of pain from the
house-tops? I know&mdash;a little about men," added Rosamund
modestly, "and they invariably say to themselves after a final
rebuff: 'Now, I'll be patient and brave and I'll bear with noble
dignity this cataclysm which has knocked the world galley-west for
me and loosened the moon in its socket and spoiled the symmetry of
the sun.' And they go about being so conspicuously brave that any
d&eacute;butante can tell what hurts them."</p>
<p>Eileen was still laughing, but not quite at her ease&mdash;the
theme being too personal to suit her. In fact, there usually seemed
to be too much personality in Rosamund's conversation&mdash;a
certain artificial indifference to convention, which she, Eileen,
did not feel any desire to disregard. For the elements of reticence
and of delicacy were inherent in her; the training of a young girl
had formalised them into rules. But since her d&eacute;but she had
witnessed and heard so many violations of convention that now she
philosophically accepted such, when they came from her elders,
merely reserving her own convictions in matters of personal taste
and conduct.</p>
<p>For a while, as they rode, Rosamund was characteristically
amusing, sailing blandly over the shoals of scandal, though Eileen
never suspected it&mdash;wittily gay at her own expense, as well as
at others, flitting airily from topic to topic on the wings of a
self-assurance that becomes some women if they know when to stop.
But presently the mischievous perversity in her bubbled up again;
she was tired of being good; she had often meant to try the effect
of a gentle shock on Miss Erroll; and, besides, she wondered just
how much truth there might be in the unpleasantly persistent rumour
of the girl's unannounced engagement to Selwyn.</p>
<p>"It <i>would</i> be amusing, wouldn't it?" she asked with
guileless frankness; "but, of course, it is not true&mdash;this
report of their reconciliation."</p>
<p>"Whose reconciliation?" asked Miss Erroll innocently.</p>
<p>"Why, Alixe Ruthven and Captain Selwyn. Everybody is discussing
it, you know."</p>
<p>"Reconciled? I don't understand," said Eileen, astonished. "They
can't be; how can&mdash;"</p>
<p>"But it <i>would</i> be amusing, wouldn't it? and she could very
easily get rid of Jack Ruthven&mdash;any woman could. So if they
really mean to remarry&mdash;"</p>
<p>The girl stared, breathless, astounded, bolt upright in her
saddle.</p>
<p>"Oh!" she protested, while the hot blood mantled throat and
cheek, "it is wickedly untrue. How could such a thing be true, Mrs.
Fane! It is&mdash;is so senseless&mdash;"</p>
<p>"That is what I say," nodded Rosamund; "it's so perfectly
senseless that it's amusing&mdash;even if they have become such
amazingly good friends again. <i>I</i> never believed there was
anything seriously sentimental in the situation; and their renewed
interest in each other is quite the most frankly sensible way out
of any awkwardness," she added cordially.</p>
<p>Miserably uncomfortable, utterly unable to comprehend, the girl
rode on in silence, her ears ringing with Rosamund's words. And
Rosamund, riding beside her, cool, blond, and cynically amused,
continued the theme with admirable pretence of indifference:</p>
<p>"It's a pity that ill-natured people are for ever discussing
them; and it makes me indignant, because I've always been very fond
of Alixe Ruthven, and I am positive that she does <i>not</i>
correspond with Captain Selwyn. A girl in her position would be
crazy to invite suspicion by doing the things they say she is
doing&mdash;"</p>
<p>"Don't, Mrs. Fane, please, don't!" stammered Eileen; "I&mdash;I
really can't listen. I simply will not!" Then bewildered, hurt, and
blindly confused as she was, the instinct to defend flashed
up&mdash;though from what she was defending him she did not
realise: "It is utterly untrue!" she exclaimed hotly&mdash;"all
that yo&mdash;all that <i>they</i> say!&mdash;whoever they
are&mdash;whatever they mean. I cannot understand it&mdash;I don't
understand, and I will not! Nor will <i>he</i>!" she added with a
scornful conviction that disconcerted Rosamund; "for if you knew
him as I do, Mrs. Fane, you would never, never have spoken as you
have."</p>
<p>Mrs. Fane relished neither the na&iuml;ve rebuke nor the
intimation that her own acquaintance with Selwyn was so limited;
and least of all did she relish the implied intimacy between this
red-haired young girl and Captain Selwyn.</p>
<p>"Dear Miss Erroll," she said blandly, "I spoke as I did only to
assure you that I, also, disregard such malicious
gossip&mdash;"</p>
<p>"But if you disregard it, Mrs. Fane, why do you repeat it?"</p>
<p>"Merely to emphasise to you my disbelief in it, child," returned
Rosamund. "Do you understand?"</p>
<p>"Y-es; thank you. Yet, I should never have heard of it at all if
you had not told me."</p>
<p>Rosamund's colour rose one degree:</p>
<p>"It is better to hear such things from a friend, is it not?"</p>
<p>"I didn't know that one's friends said such things; but perhaps
it is better that way, as you say, only, I cannot understand the
necessity of my knowing&mdash;of my hearing&mdash;because it is
Captain Selwyn's affair, after all."</p>
<p>"And that," said Rosamund deliberately, "is why I told
<i>you</i>."</p>
<p>"Told <i>me</i>? Oh&mdash;because he and I are such close
friends?"</p>
<p>"Yes&mdash;such very close friends that I"&mdash;she
laughed&mdash;"I am informed that your interests are soon to be
identical."</p>
<p>The girl swung round, self-possessed, but dreadfully pale.</p>
<p>"If you believed that," she said, "it was vile of you to say
what you said, Mrs. Fane."</p>
<p>"But I did <i>not</i> believe it, child!" stammered Rosamund,
several degrees redder than became her, and now convinced that it
was true. "I n-never dreamed of offending you, Miss
Erroll&mdash;"</p>
<p>"Do you suppose I am too ignorant to take offence?" said the
girl unsteadily. "I told you very plainly that I did not understand
the matters you chose for discussion; but I do understand
impertinence when I am driven to it."</p>
<p>"I am very, very sorry that you believe I meant it that way,"
said Rosamund, biting her lips.</p>
<p>"What did you mean? You are older than I, you are certainly
experienced; besides, you are married. If you can give it a gentler
name than insolence I would be glad&mdash;for your sake, Mrs. Fane.
I only know that you have spoiled my ride, spoiled the day for me,
hurt me, humiliated me, and awakened, not curiosity, not suspicion,
but the horror of it, in me. You did it once before&mdash;at the
Minsters' dance; not, perhaps, that you deliberately meant to; but
you did it. And your subject was then, as it is now, Captain
Selwyn&mdash;my friend&mdash;"</p>
<p>Her voice became unsteady again and her mouth curved; but she
held her head high and her eyes were as fearlessly direct as a
child's.</p>
<p>"And now," she said calmly, "you know where I stand and what I
will not stand. Natural deference to an older woman, the natural
self-distrust of a girl in the presence of social
experience&mdash;and under its protection as she had a right to
suppose&mdash;prevented me from checking you when your conversation
became distasteful. You, perhaps, mistook my reticence for
acquiescence; and you were mistaken. I am still quite willing to
remain on agreeable terms with you, if you wish, and to forget what
you have done to me this morning."</p>
<p>If Rosamund had anything left to say, or any breath to say it,
there were no indications of it. Never in her flippant existence
had she been so absolutely flattened by any woman. As for this
recent graduate from fudge and olives, she could scarcely realise
how utterly and finally she had been silenced by her. Incredulity,
exasperation, amazement had succeeded each other while Miss Erroll
was speaking; chagrin, shame, helplessness followed as bitter
residue. But, in the end, the very incongruity of the situation
came to her aid; for Rosamund very easily fell a prey to the
absurd&mdash;even when the amusement was furnished at her own
expense; and a keen sense of the ridiculous had more than once
saved her dainty skirts from a rumpling that her modesty perhaps
might have forgiven.</p>
<p>"I'm certainly a little beast," she said impulsively, "but I
really do like you. Will you forgive?"</p>
<p>No genuine appeal to the young girl's generosity had ever been
in vain; she forgave almost as easily as she breathed. Even now in
the flush of just resentment it was not hard for her to forgive;
she hesitated only in order to adjust matters in her own mind.</p>
<p>Mrs. Fane swung her horse and held out her right hand:</p>
<p>"Is it <i>pax</i>, Miss Erroll? I'm really ashamed of myself.
Won't you forgive me?"</p>
<p>"Yes," said the young girl, laying her gloved hand on Rosamund's
very lightly; "I've often thought," she added na&iuml;vely, "that I
could like you, Mrs. Fane, if you would only give me a chance."</p>
<p>"I'll try&mdash;you blessed innocent! You've torn me into rags
and tatters, and you did it adorably. What I said was idle,
half-witted, gossiping nonsense. So forget every atom of it as soon
as you can, my dear, and let me prove that I'm not an utter idiot,
if <i>I</i> can."</p>
<p>"That will be delightful," said Eileen with a demure smile; and
Rosamund laughed, too, with full-hearted laughter; for trouble sat
very lightly on her perfect shoulders in the noontide of her
strength and youth. Sin and repentance were rapid matters with
Rosamund; cause, effect, and remorse a quick sequence to be quickly
reckoned up, checked off, and cancelled; and the next blank page
turned over to be ruled and filled with the next impeachment.</p>
<p>There was, in her, more of mischief than of real malice; and if
she did pinch people to see them wiggle it was partly because she
supposed that the pain would be as momentary as the pinch; for
nothing lasted with her, not even the wiggle. So why should the
pain produced by a furtive tweak interfere with the amusement she
experienced in the victim's jump?</p>
<p>But what had often saved her from a social lynching was her
ability to laugh at her own discomfiture, and her unfeigned liking
and respect for the turning worm.</p>
<hr style='width: 45%;' />
<p>"And, my dear," she said, concluding the account of the
adventure to Mrs. Ruthven that afternoon at Sherry's, "I've never
been so roundly abused and so soundly trounced in my life as I was
this blessed morning by that red-headed novice! Oh, my! Oh, la! I
could have screamed with laughter at my own undoing."</p>
<p>"It's what you deserved," said Alixe, intensely annoyed,
although Rosamund had not told her all that she had so kindly and
gratuitously denied concerning her relations with Selwyn. "It was
sheer effrontery of you, Rosamund, to put such notions into the
head of a child and stir her up into taking a fictitious interest
in Philip Selwyn which I know&mdash;which is perfectly plain to
m&mdash;to anybody never existed!"</p>
<p>"Of course it existed!" retorted Rosamund, delighted now to
worry Alixe. "She didn't know it; that is all. It really was simple
charity to wake her up. It's a good match, too, and so obviously
and naturally inevitable that there's no harm in playing
prophetess. . . . Anyway, what do <i>we</i> care, dear? Unless
you&mdash;"</p>
<p>"Rosamund!" said Mrs. Ruthven exasperated, "will you ever
acquire the elements of reticence? I don't know why people endure
you; I don't, indeed! And they won't much longer&mdash;"</p>
<p>"Yes, they will, dear; that's what society is for&mdash;a
protective association for the purpose of enduring impossible
people. . . . I wish," she added, "that it included husbands,
because in some sets it's getting to be one dreadful case of who's
whose. Don't you think so?"</p>
<p>Alixe, externally calm but raging inwardly, sat pulling on her
gloves, heartily sorry she had lunched with Rosamund.</p>
<p>The latter, already gloved, had risen and was coolly surveying
the room.</p>
<p>"<i>Tiens!</i>" she said, "there is the youthful brother of our
red-haired novice, now. He sees us and he's coming to inflict
himself&mdash;with another moon-faced creature. Shall we bolt?"</p>
<p>Alixe turned and stared at Gerald, who came up boyishly red and
impetuous:</p>
<p>"How d'ye do, Mrs. Ruthven; did you get my note? How d'ye do,
Mrs. Fane; awf'fly jolly to collide this way. Would you mind
if&mdash;"</p>
<p>"You," interrupted Rosamund, "ought to be
<i>down</i>town&mdash;unless you've concluded to retire and let
Wall Street go to smash. What are you pretending to do in Sherry's
at this hour, you very dreadful infant?"</p>
<p>"I've been lunching with Mr. Neergard&mdash;and <i>would</i> you
mind&mdash;"</p>
<p>"Yes, I would," began Rosamund, promptly, but Alixe interrupted:
"Bring him over, Gerald." And as the boy thanked her and turned
back:</p>
<p>"I've a word to administer to that boy, Rosamund, so attack the
Neergard creature with moderation, please. You owe me <i>that</i>
at least."</p>
<p>"No, I don't!" said Rosamund, disgusted; "I <i>won't</i> be
afflicted with a&mdash;"</p>
<p>"Nobody wants you to be too civil to him, silly! But Gerald is
in his office, and I want Gerald to do something for me. Please,
Rosamund."</p>
<p>"Oh, well, if you&mdash;"</p>
<p>"Yes, I do. Here he is now; and <i>don't</i> be impossible and
frighten him, Rosamund."</p>
<p>The presentation of Neergard was accomplished without disaster
to anybody. On his thin nose the dew glistened, and his thick fat
hands were hot; but Rosamund was too bored to be rude to him, and
Alixe turned immediately to Gerald:</p>
<p>"Yes, I did get your note, but I'm not at home on Tuesday. Can't
you come&mdash;wait a moment!&mdash;what are you doing this
afternoon?"</p>
<p>"Why, I'm going back to the office with Mr. Neergard&mdash;"</p>
<p>"Nonsense! Oh, Mr. Neergard, <i>would</i> you mind"&mdash;very
sweetly&mdash;"if Mr. Erroll did not go to the office this
afternoon?"</p>
<p>Neergard looked at her&mdash;almost&mdash;a fixed and
uncomfortable smirk on his round, red face: "Not at all, Mrs.
Ruthven, if you have anything better for him&mdash;"</p>
<p>"I have&mdash;an allopathic dose of it. Thank you, Mr. Neergard.
Rosamund, we ought to start, you know: Gerald!"&mdash;with quiet
significance&mdash;"<i>good</i>-bye, Mr. Neergard. Please do not
buy up the rest of Long Island, because we need a new
kitchen-garden very badly."</p>
<p>Rosamund scarcely nodded his dismissal. And the next moment
Neergard found himself quite alone, standing with the smirk still
stamped on his stiffened features, his hat-brim and gloves crushed
in his rigid fingers, his little black mousy eyes fixed on nothing,
as usual.</p>
<p>A wandering head-waiter thought they were fixed on him and
sidled up hopeful of favours, but Neergard suddenly snarled in his
face and moved toward the door, wiping the perspiration from his
nose with the most splendid handkerchief ever displayed east of
Sixth Avenue and west of Third.</p>
<p>Mrs. Ruthven's motor moved up from its waiting station; Rosamund
was quite ready to enter when Alixe said cordially: "Where can we
drop you, dear? <i>Do</i> let us take you to the exchange if you
are going there&mdash;"</p>
<p>Now Rosamund had meant to go wherever they were going, merely
because they evidently wished to be alone. The abruptness of the
check both irritated and amused her.</p>
<p>"If I knew anybody in the Bronx I'd make you take me there," she
said vindictively; "but as I don't you may drop me at the
Orchils'&mdash;you uncivil creatures. Gerald, I know <i>you</i>
want me, anyway, because you've promised to adore, honour, and obey
me. . . . If you'll come with me now I'll play double dummy with
you. No? Well, of all ingratitude! . . . Thank you, dear, I
perceive that this is Fifth Avenue, and furthermore that this
ramshackle chassis of yours has apparently broken down at the
Orchils' curb. . . . Good-bye, Gerald; it never did run smooth, you
know. I mean the course of T.L. as well as this motor. Try to be a
good boy and keep moving; a rolling stone acquires a polish, and
you are not in the moss-growing business, I'm sure&mdash;"</p>
<p>"Rosamund! For goodness' sake!" protested Alixe, her gloved
hands at her ears.</p>
<p>"Dear!" said Rosamund cheerfully, "take your horrid little
boy!"</p>
<p>And she smiled dazzlingly upon Gerald, then turned up her pretty
nose at him, but permitted him to attend her to the door.</p>
<p>When he returned to Alixe, and the car was speeding Parkward, he
began again, eagerly:</p>
<p>"Jack asked me to come up and, of course, I let you know, as I
promised I would. But it's all right, Mrs. Ruthven, because Jack
said the stakes will not be high this time&mdash;"</p>
<p>"You accepted!" demanded Alixe, in quick displeasure.</p>
<p>"Why, yes&mdash;as the stakes are not to amount to
anything&mdash;"</p>
<p>"Gerald!"</p>
<p>"What?" he said uneasily.</p>
<p>"You promised me that you would not play again in my house!"</p>
<p>"I&mdash;I said, for more than I could afford&mdash;"</p>
<p>"No, you said you would not play; that is what you promised,
Gerald."</p>
<p>"Well, I meant for high stakes; I&mdash;well, you don't want to
drive me out altogether&mdash;even from the perfectly harmless
pleasure of playing for nominal stakes&mdash;"</p>
<p>"Yes, I do!"</p>
<p>"W-why?" asked the boy in hurt surprise.</p>
<p>"Because it is dangerous sport, Gerald&mdash;"</p>
<p>"What! To play for a few cents a point&mdash;"</p>
<p>"Yes, to play for anything. And as far as that goes there will
be no such play as you imagine."</p>
<p>"Yes, there will&mdash;I beg your pardon&mdash;but Jack Ruthven
said so&mdash;"</p>
<p>"Gerald, listen to me. A bo&mdash;a man like yourself has no
business playing with people whose losses never interfere with
their appetites next day. A business man has no right to play such
a game, anyway. I wonder what Mr. Neergard would say if he knew
you&mdash;"</p>
<p>"Neergard! Why, he does know."</p>
<p>"You confessed to him?"</p>
<p>"Y-es; I had to. I was obliged to&mdash;to ask somebody for an
advance&mdash;"</p>
<p>"You went to him? Why didn't you go to Captain Selwyn?&mdash;or
to Mr. Gerard?"</p>
<p>"I did!&mdash;not to Captain Selwyn&mdash;I was ashamed to. But
I went to Austin and he fired up and lit into me&mdash;and we had a
muss-up&mdash;and I've stayed away since."</p>
<p>"Oh, Gerald! And it simply proves me right."</p>
<p>"No, it doesn't; I did go to Neergard and made a clean breast of
it. And he let me have what I wanted like a good fellow&mdash;"</p>
<p>"And made you promise not to do it again!"</p>
<p>"No, he didn't; he only laughed. Besides, he said that he wished
he had been in the game&mdash;"</p>
<p>"What!" exclaimed Alixe.</p>
<p>"He's a first-rate fellow," insisted Gerald, reddening; "and it
was very nice of you to let me bring him over to-day. . . . And he
knows everybody downtown, too. He comes from a very old Dutch
family, but he had to work pretty hard and do without college. . .
. I'd like it awfully if you'd let me&mdash;if you wouldn't mind
being civil to him&mdash;once or twice, you know&mdash;"</p>
<p>Mrs. Ruthven lay back in her seat, thoroughly annoyed.</p>
<p>"My theory," insisted the boy with generous conviction, "is that
a man is what he makes himself. People talk about climbers and
butters-in, but where would anybody be in this town if nobody had
ever butted in? It's all rot, this aping the caste rules of
established aristocracies; a decent fellow ought to be encouraged.
Anyway, I'm going to propose, him for the Stuyvesant and the
Proscenium. Why not?"</p>
<p>"I see. And now you propose to bring him to my house?"</p>
<p>"If you'll let me. I asked Jack and he seemed to think it might
be all right if you cared to ask him to play&mdash;"</p>
<p>"I won't!" cried Alixe, revolted. "I will not turn my
drawing-rooms into a clearing-house for every money-laden social
derelict in town! I've had enough of that; I've endured the
accumulated wreckage too long!&mdash;weird treasure-craft full of
steel and oil and coal and wheat and Heaven knows what!&mdash;I
won't do it, Gerald; I'm sick of it all&mdash;sick! sick!"</p>
<p>The sudden, flushed outburst stunned the boy. Bewildered, he
stared round-eyed at the excited young matron who was growing more
incensed and more careless of what she exposed every second:</p>
<p>"I will not make a public gambling-hell out of my own house!"
she repeated, dark eyes very bright and cheeks afire; "I will not
continue to stand sponsor for a lot of queer people simply because
they don't care what they lose in Mrs. Ruthven's house! You babble
to me of limits, Gerald; this is the limit! Do you&mdash;or does
anybody else suppose that I don't know what is being said about
us?&mdash;that play is too high in our house?&mdash;that we are not
too difficile in our choice of intimates as long as they can stand
the pace!"</p>
<p>"I&mdash;I never believed that," insisted the boy, miserable to
see the tears flash in her eyes and her mouth quiver.</p>
<p>"You may as well believe it for it's true!" she said,
exasperated.</p>
<p>"T-true!&mdash;Mrs. Ruthven!"</p>
<p>"Yes, true, Gerald! I&mdash;I don't care whether you know it; I
don't care, as long as you stay away. I'm sick of it all, I tell
you. Do you think I was educated for this?&mdash;for the wife of a
chevalier of industry&mdash;"</p>
<p>"M-Mrs. Ruthven!" he gasped; but she was absolutely reckless
now&mdash;and beneath it all, perhaps, lay a certainty of the boy's
honour. She knew he was to be trusted&mdash;was the safest
receptacle for wrath so long repressed. She let prudence go with a
parting and vindictive slap, and opened her heart to the astounded
boy. The tempest lasted a few seconds; then she ended as abruptly
as she began.</p>
<p>To him she had always been what a pretty young matron usually is
to a well-bred but hare-brained youth just untethered. Their
acquaintance had been for him a combination of charming experiences
diluted with gratitude for her interest and a harmless
<i>soup&ccedil;on</i> of sentimentality. In her particular case,
however, there was a little something more&mdash;a hint of the
forbidden&mdash;a troubled enjoyment, because he knew, of course,
that Mrs. Ruthven was on no footing at all with the Gerards. So in
her friendship he savoured a piquancy not at all distasteful to a
very young man's palate.</p>
<p>But now!&mdash;he had never, never seen her like this&mdash;nor
any woman, for that matter&mdash;and he did not know where to look
or what to do.</p>
<p>She was sitting back in the limousine, very limp and flushed;
and the quiver of her under lip and the slightest dimness of her
averted brown eyes distressed him dreadfully.</p>
<p>"Dear Mrs. Ruthven," he blurted out with clumsy sympathy, "you
mustn't think such things, b-because they're all rot, you see; and
if any fellow ever said those things to me I'd jolly
soon&mdash;"</p>
<p>"Do you mean to say you've never heard us criticised?"</p>
<p>"I&mdash;well&mdash;everybody is&mdash;criticised, of
course&mdash;"</p>
<p>"But not as we are! Do you read the papers? Well, then, do you
understand how a woman must feel to have her husband continually
made the butt of foolish, absurd, untrue stories&mdash;as though he
were a performing poodle! I&mdash;I'm sick of that, too, for
another thing. Week after week, month by month, unpleasant things
have been accumulating; and they're getting too heavy,
Gerald&mdash;too crushing for my shoulders. . . . Men call me
restless. What wonder! Women link my name with any man who is
k-kind to me! Is there no excuse then for what they call my
restlessness? . . . What woman would not be restless whose private
affairs are the gossip of everybody? Was it not enough that I
endured terrific publicity when&mdash;when trouble overtook me two
years ago? . . . I suppose I'm a fool to talk like this; but a girl
must do it some time or burst!&mdash;and to whom am I to go? . . .
There was only one person; and I can't talk to&mdash;that one;
he&mdash;that person knows too much about me, anyway; which is not
good for a woman, Gerald, not good for a good woman. . . . I mean a
pretty good woman; the kind people's sisters can still talk to, you
know. . . . For I'm nothing more interesting than a
<i>divorc&eacute;e</i>, Gerald; nothing more dangerous than an
unhappy little fool. . . . I wish I were. . . . But I'm still at
the wheel! . . . A man I know calls it hard steering but assures me
that there's anchorage ahead. . . . He's a splendid fellow, Gerald;
you ought to know him&mdash;well&mdash;some day; he's just a
clean-cut, human, blundering, erring, unreasonable, lovable man
whom any woman, who is not a fool herself, could manage. . . . Some
day I should like to have you know him&mdash;intimately. He's good
for people of your sort&mdash;even good for a restless, purposeless
woman of my sort. Peace to him!&mdash;if there's any in the world.
. . . Turn your back; I'm sniveling."</p>
<p>A moment afterward she had calmed completely; and now she stole
a curious side glance at the boy and blushed a little when he
looked back at her earnestly. Then she smiled and quietly withdrew
the hand he had been holding so tightly in both of his.</p>
<p>"So there we are, my poor friend," she concluded with a shrug;
"the old penny shocker, you know, 'Alone in a great
city!'&mdash;I've dropped my handkerchief."</p>
<p>"I want you to believe me your friend," said Gerald, in the low,
resolute voice of unintentional melodrama.</p>
<p>"Why, thank you; are you so sure you want that, Gerald?"</p>
<p>"Yes, as long as I live!" he declared, generous emotion in the
ascendant. A pretty woman upset him very easily even under normal
circumstances. But beauty in distress knocked him flat&mdash;as it
does every wholesome boy who is worth his salt.</p>
<p>And he said so in his own na&iuml;ve fashion; and the more
eloquent he grew the more excited he grew and the deeper and
blacker appeared her wrongs to him.</p>
<p>At first she humoured him, and rather enjoyed his fresh, eager
sympathy; after a little his increasing ardour inclined her to
laugh; but it was very splendid and chivalrous and genuine ardour,
and the inclination to laugh died out, for emotion is contagious,
and his earnestness not only flattered her legitimately but stirred
the slackened tension of her heart-strings until, tightening again,
they responded very faintly.</p>
<p>"I had no idea that <i>you</i> were lonely," he declared.</p>
<p>"Sometimes I am, a little, Gerald." She ought to have known
better. Perhaps she did.</p>
<p>"Well," he began, "couldn't I come and&mdash;"</p>
<p>"No, Gerald."</p>
<p>"I mean just to see you sometimes and have another of these
jolly talks&mdash;"</p>
<p>"Do you call this a jolly talk?"&mdash;with deep reproach.</p>
<p>"Why&mdash;not exactly; but I'm awfully interested, Mrs.
Ruthven, and we understand each other so well&mdash;"</p>
<p>"I don't understand <i>you</i>", she was imprudent enough to
say.</p>
<p>This was delightful! Certainly he must be a particularly sad and
subtle dog if this clever but misunderstood young matron found him
what in romance is known as an "enigma."</p>
<p>So he protested with smiling humility that he was quite
transparent; she insisted on doubting him and contrived to look
disturbed in her mind concerning the probable darkness of that past
so dear to any young man who has had none.</p>
<p>As for Alixe, she also was mildly flattered&mdash;a trifle
disdainfully perhaps, but still genuinely pleased at the honesty of
this crude devotion. She was touched, too; and, besides, she
trusted him; for he was clearly as transparent as the spring air.
Also most women lugged a boy about with them; she had had several,
but none as nice as Gerald. To tie him up and tack his license on
was therefore natural to her; and if she hesitated to conclude his
subjection in short order it was that, far in a corner of her
restless soul, there hid an ever-latent fear of Selwyn; of his
opinions concerning her fitness to act mentor to the boy of whom he
was fond, and whose devotion to him was unquestioned.</p>
<p>Yet now, in spite of that&mdash;perhaps even partly because of
it, she decided on the summary taming of Gerald; so she let her
hand fall, by accident, close to his on the cushioned seat, to see
what he'd do about it.</p>
<p>It took him some time to make up his mind; but when he did he
held it so gingerly, so respectfully, that she was obliged to look
out of the window. Clearly he was quite the safest and nicest of
all the unfledged she had ever possessed.</p>
<p>"Please, don't," she said sadly.</p>
<p>And by that token she took him for her own.</p>
<hr style='width: 45%;' />
<p>She was very light-hearted that evening when she dropped him at
the Stuyvesant Club and whizzed away to her own house, for he had
promised not to play again on her premises, and she had promised to
be nice to him and take him about when she was shy of an escort.
She also repeated that he was truly an "enigma" and that she was
beginning to be a little afraid of him, which was an economical way
of making him very proud and happy. Being his first case of beauty
in distress, and his first harmless love-affair with a married
woman, he looked about him as he entered the club and felt truly
that he had already outgrown the young and callow innocents who
haunted it.</p>
<hr style='width: 45%;' />
<p>On her way home Alixe smilingly reviewed the episode until doubt
of Selwyn's approval crept in again; and her amused smile had faded
when she reached her home.</p>
<p>The house of Ruthven was a small but ultra-modern limestone
affair, between Madison and Fifth; a pocket-edition of the larger
mansions of their friends, but with less excuse for the
overelaboration since the dimensions were only twenty by a hundred.
As a matter of fact its narrow ornate facade presented not a single
quiet space the eyes might rest on after a tiring attempt to follow
and codify the arabesques, foliations, and intricate vermiculations
of what some disrespectfully dubbed as "near-aissance."</p>
<p>However, into this limestone bonbon-box tripped Mrs. Ruthven,
mounted the miniature stairs with a whirl of her scented skirts,
peeped into the drawing-room, but continued mounting until she
whipped into her own apartments, separated from those of her lord
and master by a locked door.</p>
<p>That is, the door had been locked for a long, long time; but
presently, to her intense surprise and annoyance, it slowly opened,
and a little man appeared in slippered feet.</p>
<p>He was a little man, and plump, and at first glance his face
appeared boyish and round and quite guiltless of hair or of any
hope of it.</p>
<p>But, as he came into the electric light, the hardness of his
features was apparent; he was no boy; a strange idea that he had
never been assailed some people. His face was puffy and pallid and
faint blue shadows hinted of closest shaving; and the line from the
wing of the nostrils to the nerveless corners of his thin, hard
mouth had been deeply bitten by the acid of unrest.</p>
<p>For the remainder he wore pale-rose pajamas under a
silk-and-silver kimona, an obi pierced with a jewelled scarf-pin;
and he was smoking a cigarette as thin as a straw.</p>
<p>"Well!" said his young wife in astonished displeasure,
instinctively tucking her feet&mdash;from which her maid had just
removed the shoes&mdash;under her own chamber-robe.</p>
<p>"Send her out a moment," he said, with a nod of his head toward
the maid. His voice was agreeable and full&mdash;a trifle precise
and overcultivated, perhaps.</p>
<p>When the maid retired, Alixe sat up on the lounge, drawing her
skirts down over her small stockinged feet.</p>
<p>"What on earth is the matter?" she demanded.</p>
<p>"The matter is," he said, "that Gerald has just telephoned me
from the Stuyvesant that he isn't coming."</p>
<p>"Well?"</p>
<p>"No, it isn't well. This is some of your meddling."</p>
<p>"What if it is?" she retorted; but her breath was coming
quicker.</p>
<p>"I'll tell you; you can get up and ring him up and tell him you
expect him to-night."</p>
<p>She shook her head, eyeing him all the while.</p>
<p>"I won't do it, Jack. What do you want him for? He can't play
with the people who play here; he doesn't know the rudiments of
play. He's only a boy; his money is so tied up that he has to
borrow if he loses very much. There's no sport in playing with a
boy like that&mdash;"</p>
<p>"So you've said before, I believe, but I'm better qualified to
judge than you are. Are you going to call him up?"</p>
<p>"No, I am not."</p>
<p>He turned paler. "Get up and go to that telephone!"</p>
<p>"You little whippet," she said slowly, "I was once a soldier's
wife&mdash;the only decent thing I ever have been. This bullying
ends now&mdash;here, at this instant! If you've any dirty work to
do, do it yourself. I've done my share and I've finished."</p>
<p>He was astonished; that was plain enough. But it was the sudden
overwhelming access of fury that weakened him and made him turn,
hand outstretched, blindly seeking for a chair. Rage, even real
anger, were emotions he seldom had to reckon with, for he was a
very tired and bored and burned-out gentleman, and vivid emotion
was not good for his arteries, the doctors told him.</p>
<p>He found his chair, stood a moment with his back toward his
wife, then very slowly let himself down into the chair and sat
facing her. There was moisture on his soft, pallid skin, a nervous
twitching of the under lip; he passed one heavily ringed hand
across his closely shaven jaw, still staring at her.</p>
<p>"I want to tell you something," he said. "You've got to stop
your interference with my affairs, and stop it now."</p>
<p>"I am not interested in your affairs," she said unsteadily,
still shaken by her own revolt, still under the shock of her own
arousing to a resistance that had been long, long overdue. "If you
mean," she went on, "that the ruin of this boy is your affair, then
I'll make it mine from this moment. I've told you that he shall not
play; and he shall not. And while I'm about it I'll admit what you
are preparing to accuse me of; I <i>did</i> make Sandon Craig
promise to keep away; I <i>did</i> try to make that little fool
Scott Innis promise, too; and when he wouldn't I informed his
father. . . . And every time you try your dirty bucket-shop methods
on boys like that, I'll do the same."</p>
<p>He swore at her quite calmly; she smiled, shrugged, and,
imprisoning her knees in her clasped hands, leaned back and looked
at him.</p>
<p>"What a ninny I have been," she said, "to be afraid of you so
long!"</p>
<p>A gleam crossed his faded eyes, but he let her remark pass for
the moment. Then, when he was quite sure that violent emotion had
been exhausted within him:</p>
<p>"Do you want your bills paid?" he asked. "Because, if you do,
Fane, Harmon &amp; Co. are not going to pay them."</p>
<p>"We are living beyond our means?" she inquired disdainfully.</p>
<p>"Not if you will be good enough to mind your business, my
friend. I've managed this establishment on our winnings for two
years. It's a detail; but you might as well know it. My association
with Fane, Harmon &amp; Co. runs the Newport end of it, and nothing
more."</p>
<p>"What did you marry me for?" she asked curiously.</p>
<p>A slight colour came into his face: "Because that damned
Rosamund Fane lied about you."</p>
<p>"Oh! . . . You knew that in Manila? You'd heard about it, hadn't
you&mdash;the Western timber-lands? Rosamund didn't mean to
lie&mdash;only the titles were all wrong, you know. . . . And so
you made a bad break, Jack; is that it?"</p>
<p>"Yes, that is it."</p>
<p>"And it cost you a fortune, and me a&mdash;husband. Is that it,
my friend?"</p>
<p>"I can afford you if you will stop your meddling," he said
coolly.</p>
<p>"I see; I am to stop my meddling and you are to continue your
downtown gambling in your own house in the evenings."</p>
<p>"Precisely. It happens that I am sufficiently familiar with the
stock-market to make a decent living out of the Exchange; and it
also happens that I am sufficiently fortunate with cards to make
the pleasure of playing fairly remunerative. Any man who can put up
proper margin has a right to my services; any man whom I invite and
who can take up his notes, has a right to play under my roof. If
his note goes to protest, he forfeits that right. Now will you
kindly explain to yourself exactly how this matter can be of any
interest to you?"</p>
<p>"I have explained it," she said wearily. "Will you please go,
now?"</p>
<p>He sat a moment, then rose:</p>
<p>"You make a point of excluding Gerald?"</p>
<p>"Yes."</p>
<p>"Very well; I'll telephone Draymore. And"&mdash;he looked back
from the door of his own apartments&mdash;"I got Julius Neergard on
the wire this afternoon and he'll dine with us."</p>
<p>He gathered up his shimmering kimona, hesitated, halted, and
again looked back.</p>
<p>"When you're dressed," he drawled, "I've a word to say to you
about the game to-night, and another about Gerald."</p>
<p>"I shall not play," she retorted scornfully, "nor will
Gerald."</p>
<p>"Oh, yes, you will&mdash;and play your best, too. And I'll
expect him next time."</p>
<p>"I shall not play!"</p>
<p>He said deliberately: "You will not only play, but play
cleverly; and in the interim, while dressing, you will reflect how
much more agreeable it is to play cards here than the fool at ten
o'clock at night in the bachelor apartments of your late
lamented."</p>
<p>And he entered his room; and his wife, getting blindly to her
feet, every atom of colour gone from lip and cheek, stood rigid,
both small hands clutching the foot-board of the gilded bed.</p>

<h3>THE UNEXPECTED</h3>
<p>Differences of opinion between himself and Neergard concerning
the ethics of good taste involved in forcing the Siowitha Club
matter, Gerald's decreasing attention to business and increasing
intimacy with the Fane-Ruthven coterie, began to make Selwyn very
uncomfortable. The boy's close relations with Neergard worried him
most of all; and though Neergard finally agreed to drop the
Siowitha matter as a fixed policy in which Selwyn had been expected
to participate at some indefinite date, the arrangement seemed only
to cement the man's confidential companionship with Gerald.</p>
<p>This added to Selwyn's restlessness; and one day in early spring
he had a long conference with Gerald&mdash;a most unsatisfactory
one. Gerald, for the first time, remained reticent; and when
Selwyn, presuming on the cordial understanding between them,
pressed him a little, the boy turned sullen; and Selwyn let the
matter drop very quickly.</p>
<p>But neither tact nor caution seemed to serve now; Gerald, more
and more engrossed in occult social affairs of which he made no
mention to Selwyn, was still amiable and friendly, even at times
cordial and lovable; but he was no longer frank or even
communicative; and Selwyn, fearing to arouse him again to
sullenness or perhaps even to suspicious defiance, forbore to press
him beyond the most tentative advances toward the regaining of his
confidence.</p>
<p>This, very naturally, grieved and mortified the elder man; but
what troubled him still more was that Gerald and Neergard were
becoming so amazingly companionable; for it was easy to see that
they had in common a number of personal interests which he did not
share, and that their silence concerning these interests amounted
to a secrecy almost offensive.</p>
<p>Again and again, coming unexpectedly upon them, he noticed that
their confab ceased with his appearance. Often, too, glances of
warning intelligence passed between them in his presence, which, no
doubt, they supposed were unnoticed by him.</p>
<p>They left the office together frequently, now; they often
lunched uptown. Whether they were in each other's company evenings,
Selwyn did not know, for Gerald no longer volunteered information
as to his whereabouts or doings. And all this hurt Selwyn, and
alarmed him, too, for he was slowly coming to the conclusion that
he did not like Neergard, that he would never sign articles of
partnership with him, and that even his formal associateship with
the company was too close a relation for his own peace of mind. But
on Gerald's account he stayed on; he did not like to leave the boy
alone for his sister's sake as well as for his own.</p>
<p>Matters drifted that way through early spring. He actually grew
to dislike both Neergard and the business of Neergard &amp;
Co.&mdash;for no one particular reason, perhaps, but in general;
though he did not yet care to ask himself to be more precise in his
unuttered criticisms.</p>
<p>However, detail and routine, the simpler alphabet of the
business, continued to occupy him. He consulted both Neergard and
Gerald as usual; they often consulted him or pretended to do so.
Land was bought and sold and resold, new projects discussed, new
properties appraised, new mortgage loans negotiated; and solely
because of his desire to remain near Gerald, this sort of thing
might have continued indefinitely. But Neergard broke his word to
him.</p>
<p>And one morning, before he left his rooms at Mrs. Greeve's
lodgings to go downtown, Percy Draymore called him up on the
telephone; and as that overfed young man's usual rising hour was
notoriously nearer noon than eight o'clock, it surprised Selwyn to
be asked to remain in his rooms for a little while until Draymore
and one or two friends could call on him personally concerning a
matter of importance.</p>
<p>He therefore breakfasted leisurely; and he was still scanning
the real estate columns of a morning paper when Mrs. Greeve came
panting to his door and ushered in a file of rather sleepy but
important looking gentlemen, evidently unaccustomed to being abroad
so early, and bored to death with their experience.</p>
<p>They were men he knew only formally, or, at best, merely as
fellow club members; men whom he met when a dance or dinner took
him out of the less pretentious sets he personally affected; men
whom the newspapers and the public knew too well to speak of as
"well known."</p>
<p>First there was Percy Draymore, overgroomed for a gentleman,
fat, good-humoured, and fashionable&mdash;one of the famous
Draymore family noted solely for their money and their tight grip
on it; then came Sanxon Orchil, the famous banker and promoter,
small, urbane, dark, with that rich almost oriental coloring which
he may have inherited from his Cordova ancestors who found it
necessary to dehumanise their names when Rome offered them the
choice with immediate eternity as alternative.</p>
<p>Then came a fox-faced young man, Phoenix Mottly, elegant arbiter
of all pertaining to polo and the hunt&mdash;slim-legged,
hatchet-faced&mdash;and more presentable in the saddle than out of
it. He was followed by Bradley Harmon, with his washed-out
colouring of a consumptive Swede and his corn-coloured beard; and,
looming in the rear like an amiable brontasaurus, George Fane,
whose swaying neck carried his head as a camel carries his, nodding
as he walks.</p>
<p>"Well!" said Selwyn, perplexed but cordial as he exchanged
amenities with each gentleman who entered, "this is a killing
combination of pleasure and mortification&mdash;because I haven't
any more breakfast to offer you unless you'll wait until I ring for
the Sultana&mdash;"</p>
<p>"Breakfast! Oh, damn! I've breakfasted on a pill and a glass of
vichy for ten years," protested Draymore, "and the others either
have swallowed their cocktails, or won't do it until luncheon. I
say, Selwyn, you must think this a devilishly unusual
proceeding."</p>
<p>"Pleasantly unusual, Draymore. Is this a delegation to tend me
the nomination for the down-and-out club, perhaps?"</p>
<p>Fane spoke up languidly: "It rather looks as though we were the
down-and-out delegation at present; doesn't it, Orchil?"</p>
<p>"I don't know," said Orchil; "it seems a trifle more promising
to me since I've had the pleasure of seeing Captain Selwyn face to
face. Go on, Percy; let the horrid facts be known."</p>
<p>"Well&mdash;er&mdash;oh, hang it all!" blurted out Draymore, "we
heard last night how that fellow&mdash;how Neergard has been
tampering with our farmers&mdash;what underhand tricks he has been
playing us; and I frankly admit to you that we're a worried lot of
near-sports. That's what this dismal matinee signifies; and we've
come to ask you what it all really means."</p>
<p>"We lost no time, you see," added Orchil, caressing the long
pomaded ends of his kinky moustache and trying to catch a glimpse
of them out of his languid oriental eyes. He had been trying to
catch this glimpse for thirty years; he was a persistent man with
plenty of leisure.</p>
<p>"We lost no time," repeated Draymore, "because it's a devilish
unsavoury situation for us. The Siowitha Club fully realises it,
Captain Selwyn, and its members&mdash;some of 'em&mdash;thought
that perhaps&mdash;er&mdash;you&mdash;ah&mdash;being the sort of
man who can&mdash;ah&mdash;understand the sort of language we
understand, it might not be amiss to&mdash;to&mdash;"</p>
<p>"Why did you not call on Mr. Neergard?" asked Selwyn coolly. Yet
he was taken completely by surprise, for he did not know that
Neergard had gone ahead and secured options on his own
responsibility&mdash;which practically amounted to a violation of
the truce between them.</p>
<p>Draymore hesitated, then with the brutality characteristic of
the overfed: "I don't give a damn, Captain Selwyn, what Neergard
thinks; but I do want to know what a gentleman like yourself,
accidentally associated with that man, thinks of this questionable
proceeding."</p>
<p>"Do you mean by 'questionable proceeding' your coming
here?&mdash;or do you refer to the firm's position in this matter?"
asked Selwyn sharply. "Because, Draymore, I am not very widely
experienced in the customs and usages of commercial life, and I do
not know whether it is usual for an associate member of a firm to
express, unauthorised, his views on matters concerning the firm to
any Tom, Dick, and Harry who questions him."</p>
<p>"But you know what is the policy of your own firm," suggested
Harmon, wincing, and displaying his teeth under his bright red
lips; "and all we wish to know is, what Neergard expects us to pay
for this rascally lesson in the a-b-c of Long Island realty."</p>
<p>"I don't know," replied Selwyn, bitterly annoyed, "what Mr.
Neergard proposes to do. And if I did I should refer you to
him."</p>
<p>"May I ask," began Orchil, "whether the land will be ultimately
for sale?"</p>
<p>"Oh, everything's always for sale," broke in Mottly impatiently;
"what's the use of asking that? What you meant to inquire was the
price we're expected to pay for this masterly squeeze in
realty."</p>
<p>"And to that," replied Selwyn more sharply still, "I must answer
again that I don't know. I know nothing about it; I did not know
that Mr. Neergard had acquired control of the property; I don't
know what he means to do with it. And, gentlemen, may I ask why you
feel at liberty to come to me instead of to Mr. Neergard?"</p>
<p>"A desire to deal with one of our own kind, I suppose," returned
Draymore bluntly. "And, for that matter," he said, turning to the
others, "we might have known that Captain Selwyn could have had no
hand in and no knowledge of such an underbred and dirty&mdash;"</p>
<p>Harmon plucked him by the sleeve, but Draymore shook him off,
his little piggish eyes sparkling.</p>
<p>"What do I care!" he sneered, losing his temper; "we're in the
clutches of a vulgar, skinflint Dutchman, and he'll wring <i>us</i>
dry whether or not we curse <i>him</i> out. Didn't I tell you that
Philip Selwyn had nothing to do with it? If he had, and I was
wrong, our journey here might as well have been made to Neergard's
office. For any man who will do such a filthy thing&mdash;"</p>
<p>"One moment, Draymore," cut in Selwyn; and his voice rang
unpleasantly; "if you are simply complaining because you have been
outwitted, go ahead; but if you think there has been any really
dirty business in this matter, go to Mr. Neergard. Otherwise, being
his associate, I shall not only decline to listen but also ask you
to leave my apartments."</p>
<p>"Captain Selwyn is perfectly right," observed Orchil coolly. "Do
you think, Draymore, that it is very good taste in you to come into
a man's place and begin slanging and cursing a member of his firm
for crooked work?"</p>
<p>"Besides," added Mottly, "it's not crooked; it's only
contemptible. Anyway, we know with whom we have to deal, now; but
some of you fellows must do the dealing&mdash;I'd rather pay and
keep away than ask Neergard to go easy&mdash;and have him do
it."</p>
<p>"I don't know," said Fane, grinning his saurian grin, "why you
all assume that Neergard is such a social outcast. I played cards
with him last week and he lost like a gentleman."</p>
<p>"I didn't say he was a social outcast," retorted
Mottly&mdash;"because he's never been inside of anything to be cast
out, you know."</p>
<p>"He seems to be inside this deal," ventured Orchil with his
suave smile. And to Selwyn, who had been restlessly facing first
one, then another: "We came&mdash;it was the idea of several among
us&mdash;to put the matter up to you. Which was rather foolish,
because you couldn't have engineered the thing and remained what we
know you to be. So&mdash;"</p>
<p>"Wait!" said Selwyn brusquely; "I do not admit for one moment
that there is anything dishonourable in this deal!&mdash;nor do I
accept your right to question it from that standpoint. As far as I
can see, it is one of those operations which is considered clever
among business folk, and which is admired and laughed over in
reputable business circles. And I have no doubt that hundreds of
well-meaning business men do that sort of thing daily&mdash;yes,
thousands!" He shrugged his broad shoulders. "Because I personally
have not chosen to engage in matters of
this&mdash;ah&mdash;description, is no reason for condemning the
deal or its method&mdash;"</p>
<p>"Every reason!" said Orchil, laughing
cordially&mdash;"<i>every</i> reason, Captain Selwyn. Thank you; we
know now exactly where we stand. It was very good of you to let us
come, and I'm sorry some of us had the bad taste to show any
temper&mdash;"</p>
<p>"He means me," added Draymore, offering his hand; "good-bye,
Captain Selwyn; I dare say we are up against it hard."</p>
<p>"Because we've got to buy in that property or close up the
Siowitha," added Mottly, coming over to make his adieux. "By the
way, Selwyn, you ought to be one of us in the Siowitha&mdash;"</p>
<p>"Thank you, but isn't this rather an awkward time to suggest
it?" said Selwyn good-humouredly.</p>
<p>Fane burst into a sonorous laugh and wagged his neck, saying:
"Not at all! Not at all! Your reward for having the decency to stay
out of the deal is an invitation from us to come in and be squeezed
into a jelly by Mr. Neergard. Haw! Haw!"</p>
<p>And so, one by one, with formal or informal but evidently
friendly leave-taking, they went away. And Selwyn followed them
presently, walking until he took the Subway at Forty-second Street
for his office.</p>
<p>As he entered the elaborate suite of rooms he noticed some
bright new placards dangling from the walls of the general office,
and halted to read them:</p>

Long Island Real Estate."</div>
<p>Selwyn reddened with anger and beckoned to a clerk:</p>
<p>"Is Mr. Neergard in his office?"</p>
<p>"Yes, sir, with Mr. Erroll."</p>
<p>"Please say that I wish to see him."</p>
<p>He went into his own office, pocketed his mail, and still
wearing hat and gloves came out again just as Gerald was leaving
Neergard's office.</p>
<p>"Hello, Gerald!" he said pleasantly; "have you anything on for
to-night?"</p>
<p>"Y-es," said the hoy, embarrassed&mdash;"but if there is
anything I can do for you&mdash;"</p>
<p>"Not unless you are free for the evening," returned the other;
"are you?"</p>
<p>"I'm awfully sorry&mdash;"</p>
<p>"Oh, all right. Let me know when you expect to be
free&mdash;telephone me at my rooms&mdash;"</p>
<p>"I'll let you know when I see you here to-morrow," said the boy;
but Selwyn shook his head: "I'm not coming here to-morrow, Gerald";
and he walked leisurely into Neergard's office and seated
himself.</p>
<p>"So you have committed the firm to the Siowitha deal?" he
inquired coolly.</p>
<p>Neergard looked up&mdash;and then past him: "No, not the firm.
You did not seem to be interested in the scheme, so I went on
without you. I'm swinging it for my personal account."</p>
<p>"Is Mr. Erroll in it?"</p>
<p>"I said that it was a private matter," replied Neergard, but his
manner was affable.</p>
<p>"I thought so; it appears to me like a matter quite personal to
you and characteristic of you, Mr. Neergard. And that being
established, I am now ready to dissolve whatever very loose ties
have ever bound me in any association with this company and
yourself."</p>
<p>Neergard's close-set black eyes shifted a point nearer to
Selwyn's; the sweat on his nose glistened.</p>
<p>"Why do you do this?" he asked slowly. "Has anybody offended
you?"</p>
<p>"Do you <i>really</i> wish to know?"</p>
<p>"Yes, I certainly do, Captain Selwyn."</p>
<p>"Very well; it's because I don't like your business methods, I
don't like&mdash;several other things that are happening in this
office. It's purely a difference of views; and that is enough
explanation, Mr. Neergard."</p>
<p>"I think our views may very easily coincide&mdash;"</p>
<p>"You are wrong; they could not. I ought to have known that when
I came back here. And now I have only to thank you for receiving
me, at my own request, for a six months' trial, and to admit that I
am not qualified to co-operate with this kind of a firm."</p>
<p>"That," said Neergard angrily, "amounts to an indictment of the
firm. If you express yourself in that manner outside, the firm will
certainly resent it!"</p>
<p>"My personal taste will continue to govern my expressions, Mr.
Neergard; and I believe will prevent any further business relations
between us. And, as we never had any other kind of relations, I
have merely to arrange the details through an attorney."</p>
<p>Neergard looked after him in silence; the tiny beads of sweat on
his nose united and rolled down in a big shining drop, and the
sneer etched on his broad and brightly mottled features deepened to
a snarl when Selwyn had disappeared.</p>
<p>For the social prestige which Selwyn's name had brought the
firm, he had patiently endured his personal dislike and contempt
for the man after he found he could do nothing with him in any
way.</p>
<p>He had accepted Selwyn purely in the hope of social advantage,
and with the knowledge that Selwyn could have done much for him
after business hours; if not from friendship, at least from
interest, or a lively sense of benefits to come. For that reason he
had invited him to participate in the valuable Siowitha deal,
supposing a man as comparatively poor as Selwyn would not only jump
at the opportunity, but also prove sufficiently grateful later. And
he had been amazed and disgusted at Selwyn's attitude. But he had
not supposed the man would sever his connection with the firm if
he, Neergard, went ahead on his own responsibility. It astonished
and irritated him; it meant, instead of selfish or snobbish
indifference to his own social ambitions, an enemy to block his
entrance into what he desired&mdash;the society of those made
notorious in the columns of the daily press.</p>
<p>For Neergard cared only for the notorious in the social scheme;
nothing else appealed to him. He had, all his life, read with
avidity of the extravagances, the ostentation, the luxurious
effrontery, the thinly veiled viciousness of what he believed to be
society, and he craved it from the first, working his thick hands
to the bone in dogged determination to one day participate in and
satiate himself with the easy morality of what he read about in his
penny morning paper&mdash;in the days when even a penny was to be
carefully considered.</p>
<p>That was what he wanted from society&mdash;the best to be had in
vice. That was why he had denied himself in better days. It was for
that he hoarded every cent while actual want sharpened his wits and
his thin nose; it was in that hope that he received Selwyn so
cordially as a possible means of entrance into regions he could not
attain unaided; it was for that reason he was now binding Gerald to
him through remission of penalties for slackness, through loans and
advances, through a companionship which had already landed him in
the Ruthven's card-room, and promised even more from Mr. Fane, who
had won his money very easily.</p>
<p>For Neergard did not care how he got in, front door or back
door, through kitchen or card-room, as long as he got in somehow.
All he desired was the chance to use opportunity in his own
fashion, and wring from the forbidden circle all and more than they
had unconsciously wrung from him in the squalid days of a poverty
for which no equality he might now enjoy, no liberty of license, no
fraternity in dissipation, could wholly compensate.</p>
<p>He was fairly on the outer boundary now, though still very far
outside. But a needy gentleman inside was already compromised and
practically pledged to support him; for his meeting with Jack
Ruthven through Gerald had proven of greatest importance. He had
lost gracefully to Ruthven; and in doing it had taken that
gentleman's measure. And though Ruthven himself was a member of the
Siowitha, Neergard had made no error in taking him secretly into
the deal where together they were now in a position to exploit the
club, from which Ruthven, of course, would resign in time to escape
any assessment himself.</p>
<p>Neergard's progress had now reached this stage; his programme
was simple&mdash;to wallow among the wealthy until satiated, then
to marry into that agreeable community and found the house of
Neergard. And to that end he had already bought a building site on
Fifth Avenue, but held it in the name of the firm as though it had
been acquired for purposes purely speculative.</p>
<hr style='width: 45%;' />
<p>About that time Boots Lansing very quietly bought a house on
Manhattan Island. It was a small, narrow, three-storied house of
brick, rather shabby on the outside, and situated on a modest block
between Lexington and Park avenues, where the newly married of the
younger set were arriving in increasing numbers, prepared to pay
the penalty for all love matches.</p>
<p>It was an unexpected move to Selwyn; he had not been aware of
Lansing's contemplated desertion; and that morning, returning from
his final interview with Neergard, he was astonished to find his
comrade's room bare of furniture, and a hasty and exclamatory note
on his own table:</p>
<p>"Phil! I've bought a house! Come and see it! You'll find me in
it! Carpetless floors and unpapered walls! It's the happiest day of
my life!</p>
<div class='blockquot'>"Boots!!!! House-owner!!!"</div>
<p>And Selwyn, horribly depressed, went down after a solitary
luncheon and found Lansing sitting on a pile of dusty rugs,
ecstatically inspecting the cracked ceiling.</p>
<p>"So this is the House that Boots built!" he said.</p>
<p>"Phil! It's a dream!"</p>
<p>"Yes&mdash;a bad one. What the devil do you mean by clearing
out? What do you want with a house, anyhow?&mdash;you infernal
idiot!"</p>
<p>"A house? Man, I've always wanted one! I've dreamed of a dinky
little house like this&mdash;dreamed and ached for it there in
Manila&mdash;on blistering hikes, on wibbly-wabbly
gunboats&mdash;knee-deep in sprouting rice&mdash;I've dreamed of a
house in New York like this! slopping through the steaming
paddy-fields, sweating up the heights, floundering through smelly
hemp, squatting by green fires at night! always, always I've longed
for a home of my own. Now I've got it, and I'm the happiest man on
Manhattan Island!"</p>
<p>"O Lord!" said Selwyn, staring, "if you feel that way! You never
said anything about it&mdash;"</p>
<p>"Neither did you, Phil; but I bet you want one, too. Come now;
don't you?"</p>
<p>"Yes, I do," nodded Selwyn; "but I can't afford one
yet"&mdash;his face darkened&mdash;"not for a while; but," and his
features cleared, "I'm delighted, old fellow, that <i>you</i> have
one. This certainly is a jolly little kennel&mdash;you can fix it
up in splendid shape&mdash;rugs and mahogany and what-nots and
ding-dongs&mdash;and a couple of tabby cats and a good
dog&mdash;"</p>
<p>"Isn't it fascinating!" cried Boots. "Phil, all this real estate
is mine! And the idea makes me silly-headed. I've been sitting on
this pile of rugs pretending that I'm in the midst of vast and
expensive improvements and alterations; and estimating the cost of
them has frightened me half to death. I tell you I never had such
fun, Phil. Come on; we'll start at the cellar&mdash;there is some
coal and wood and some wonderful cobwebs down there&mdash;and then
we'll take in the back yard; I mean to have no end of a garden out
there, and real clothes-dryers and some wistaria and
sparrows&mdash;just like real back yards. I want to hear cats make
harrowing music on my own back fence; I want to see a tidy
laundress pinning up intimate and indescribable garments on my own
clothes-lines; I want to have maddening trouble with plumbers and
roofers; I want to&mdash;"</p>
<p>"Come on, then, for Heaven's sake!" said Selwyn, laughing; and
the two men, arm in arm, began a minute tour of the house.</p>
<p>"Isn't it a corker! Isn't it fine!" repeated Lansing every few
minutes. "I wouldn't exchange it for any mansion on Fifth
Avenue!"</p>
<p>"You'd be a fool to," agreed Selwyn gravely.</p>
<p>"Certainly I would. Anyway, prices are going up like rockets in
this section&mdash;not that I'd think of selling out at any
price&mdash;but it's comfortable to know it. Why, a real-estate man
told me&mdash;Hello! What was that? Something fell somewhere!"</p>
<p>"A section of the bath-room ceiling, I think," said Selwyn; "we
mustn't step too heavily on the floors at first, you know."</p>
<p>"Oh, I'm going to have the entire thing done over&mdash;room by
room&mdash;when I can afford it. Meanwhile <i>j'y suis, j'y
reste</i>. . . . Look there, Phil! That's to be your room."</p>
<p>"Thanks, old fellow&mdash;not now."</p>
<p>"Why, yes! I expected you'd have your room here,
Phil&mdash;"</p>
<p>"It's very good of you, Boots, but I can't do it."</p>
<p>Lansing faced him: "<i>Won't</i> you?"</p>
<p>Selwyn, smiling, shook his head; and the other knew it was
final.</p>
<p>"Well, the room will be there&mdash;furnished the way you and I
like it. When you want it, make smoke signals or wig-wag."</p>
<p>"I will; thank you, Boots."</p>
<p>Lansing said unaffectedly, "How soon do you think you can afford
a house like this?"</p>
<p>"I don't know; you see, I've only my income now&mdash;"</p>
<p>"Plus what you make at the office&mdash;"</p>
<p>"I've left Neergard."</p>
<p>"What!"</p>
<p>"This morning; for good."</p>
<p>"The deuce!" he murmured, looking at Selwyn; but the latter
volunteered no further information, and Lansing, having given him
the chance, cheerfully switched to the other track:</p>
<p>"Shall I see whether the Air Line has anything in <i>your</i>
line, Phil? No? Well, what are you going to do?"</p>
<p>"I don't exactly know what I shall do. . . . If I had
capital&mdash;enough&mdash;I think I'd start in making bulk and
dense powders&mdash;all sorts; gun-cotton,
nitro-powders&mdash;"</p>
<p>"You mean you'd like to go on with your own
invention&mdash;Chaosite?"</p>
<p>"I'd like to keep on experimenting with it if I could afford to.
Perhaps I will. But it's not yet a commercial possibility&mdash;if
it ever is to be. I wish I could control it; the ignition is
simultaneous and absolutely complete, and there is not a trace of
ash, not an unburned or partly burned particle. But it's not to be
trusted, and I don't know what happens to it after a year's
storage."</p>
<p>For a while they discussed the commercial possibilities of
Chaosite, and how capital might be raised for a stock company; but
Selwyn was not sanguine, and something of his mental depression
returned as he sat there by the curtainless window, his head on his
closed hand, looking out into the sunny street.</p>
<p>"Anyway," said Lansing, "you've nothing to worry over."</p>
<p>"No, nothing," assented Selwyn listlessly.</p>
<p>After a silence Lansing added: "But you do a lot of worrying all
the same, Phil."</p>
<p>Selwyn flushed up and denied it.</p>
<p>"Yes, you do! I don't believe you realise how much of the time
you are out of spirits."</p>
<p>"Does it impress you that way?" asked Selwyn, mortified;
"because I'm really all right."</p>
<p>"Of course you are, Phil; I know it, but you don't seem to
realise it. You're morbid, I'm afraid."</p>
<p>"You've been talking to my sister!"</p>
<p>"What of it? Besides, I knew there was something the
matter&mdash;"</p>
<p>"You know what it is, too. And isn't it enough to subdue a man's
spirits occasionally?"</p>
<p>"No," said Lansing&mdash;"if you mean
your&mdash;mistake&mdash;two years ago. That isn't enough to spoil
life for a man. I've wanted to tell you so for a long time."</p>
<p>And, as Selwyn said nothing: "For Heaven's sake make up your
mind to enjoy your life! You are fitted to enjoy it. Get that
absurd notion out of your head that you're done for&mdash;that
you've no home life in prospect, no family life, no
children&mdash;"</p>
<p>Selwyn turned sharply, but the other went on: "You can swear at
me if you like, but you've no business to go through the world
cuddling your own troubles closer and closer and squinting at
everybody out of disenchanted eyes. It's selfish, for one thing;
you're thinking altogether too much about yourself."</p>
<p>Selwyn, too annoyed to answer, glared at his friend.</p>
<p>"Oh, I know you don't like it, Phil, but what I'm saying may do
you good. It's fine physic, to learn what others think about you;
as for me, you can't mistake my friendship&mdash;or your
sister's&mdash;or Miss Erroll's, or Mr. Gerard's. And one and all
are of one opinion, that you have everything before you, including
domestic happiness, which you care for more than anything. And
there is no reason why you should not have it&mdash;no reason why
you should not feel perfectly free to marry, and have a bunch of
corking kids. It's not only your right, it's your business; and
you're selfish if you don't!"</p>
<p>"Boots! I&mdash;I&mdash;"</p>
<p>"Go on!"</p>
<p>"I'm not going to swear; I'm only hurt, Boots&mdash;"</p>
<p>"Sure you are! Medicine's working, that's all. We strive to
please, we kill to cure. Of course it hurts, man! But you know it
will do you good; you know what I say is true. You've no right to
club the natural and healthy inclinations out of yourself. The day
for fanatics and dippy, dotty flagellants is past. Fox's martyrs
are out of date. The man who grabs life in both fists and twists
the essence out of it, counts. He is living as he ought to, he is
doing the square thing by his country and his community&mdash;by
every man, woman, and child in it! He's giving everybody, including
himself, a square deal. But the man who has been upper-cut and
floored, and who takes the count, and then goes and squats in a
corner to brood over the fancy licks that Fate handed
him&mdash;<i>he</i> isn't dealing fairly and squarely by his
principles or by a decent and generous world that stands to back
him for the next round. Is he, Phil?"</p>
<p>"Do you mean to say, Boots, that you think a man who has made
the ghastly mess of his life that I have, ought to feel free to
marry?"</p>
<p>"Think it! Man, I know it. Certainly you ought to marry if you
wish&mdash;but, above all, you ought to feel free to marry. That is
the essential equipment of a man; he isn't a man if he feels that
he isn't free to marry. He may not want to do it, he may not be in
love. That's neither here nor there; the main thing is that he is
as free as a man should be to take any good opportunity&mdash;and
marriage is included in the list of good opportunities. If you
become a slave to morbid notions, no wonder you are depressed.
Slaves usually are. Do you want to slink through life? Then shake
yourself, I tell you; learn to understand that you're free to do
what any decent man may do. That will take the morbidness out of
you. That will colour life for you. I don't say go hunting for some
one to love; I do say, don't avoid her when you meet her."</p>
<p>"You preach a very gay sermon, Boots," he said, folding his
arms. "I've heard something similar from my sister. As a matter of
fact I think you are partly right, too; but if the inclination for
the freedom you insist I take is wanting, then what? I don't wish
to marry, Boots; I am not in love, therefore the prospect of home
and kids is premature and vague, isn't it?"</p>
<p>"As long as it's a prospect or a possibility I don't care how
vague it is," said the other cordially. "Will you admit it's a
possibility? That's all I ask."</p>
<p>"If it will please you, yes, I will admit it. I have altered
certain ideas, Boots; I cannot, just now, conceive of any
circumstances under which I should feel justified in marrying, but
such circumstances might arise; I'll say that much."</p>
<p>Yet until that moment he had not dreamed of admitting as much to
anybody, even to himself; but Lansing's logic, his own loneliness,
his disappointment in Gerald, had combined to make him doubt his
own methods of procedure. Too, the interview with Alixe Ruthven had
not only knocked all complacency and conceit out of him, but had
made him so self-distrustful that he was in a mood to listen
respectfully to his peers on any question.</p>
<p>He was wondering now whether Boots had recognised Alixe when he
had blundered into the room that night. He had never asked the
question; he was very much inclined to, now. However, Boots's reply
could be only the negative answer that any decent man must
give.</p>
<p>Sitting there in the carpetless room piled high with dusty,
linen-shrouded furniture, he looked around, an involuntary smile
twitching his mouth. Somehow he had not felt so light-hearted for a
long, long while&mdash;and whether it came from his comrade's
sermon, or his own unexpected acknowledgment of its truth, or
whether it was pure amusement at Boots in the r&ocirc;le of
householder and taxpayer, he could not decide. But he was curiously
happy of a sudden; and he smiled broadly upon Mr. Lansing:</p>
<p>"What about <i>your</i> marrying," he said&mdash;"after all this
talk about mine! What about it, Boots? Is this new house the first
modest step toward the matrimony you laud so loudly?"</p>
<p>"Sure," said that gentleman airily; "that's what I'm here
for."</p>
<p>"Really?"</p>
<p>"Well, of course, idiot. I've always been in love."</p>
<p>"You mean you actually have somebody in view&mdash;?"</p>
<p>"No, son. I've always been in love with&mdash;love. I'm a
sentimental sentry on the ramparts of reason. I'm properly armed
for trouble, now, so if I'm challenged I won't let my chance slip
by me. Do you see? There are two kinds of sentimental warriors in
this amorous world: the man and the nincompoop. The one brings in
his prisoner, the other merely howls for her. So I'm all ready for
the only girl in the world; and if she ever gets away from me I'll
give you my house, cellar, and back yard, including the wistaria
and both cats&mdash;"</p>
<p>"You have neither wistaria nor cats&mdash;yet."</p>
<p>"Neither am I specifically in love&mdash;yet. So that's all
right&mdash;Philip. Come on; let's take another look at that
fascinating cellar of mine!"</p>
<p>But Selwyn laughingly declined, and after a little while he went
away, first to look up a book which he was having bound for Eileen,
then to call on his sister who, with Eileen, had just returned from
a week at Silverside with the children, preliminary to moving the
entire establishment there for the coming summer; for the horses
and dogs had already gone; also Kit-Ki, a pessimistic parrot, and
the children's two Norwegian ponies.</p>
<p>"Silverside is too lovely for words!" exclaimed Nina as Selwyn
entered the library. "The children almost went mad. You should have
seen the dogs, too&mdash;tearing round and round the lawn in
circles&mdash;poor things! They were crazy for the fresh, new turf.
And Kit-Ki! she lay in the sun and rolled and rolled until her fur
was perfectly filthy. Nobody wanted to come away; Eileen made
straight for the surf; but it was an arctic sea, and as soon as I
found out what she was doing I made her come out."</p>
<p>"I should think you would," he said; "nobody can do that and
thrive."</p>
<p>"She seems to," said Nina; "she was simply glorious after the
swim, and I hated to put a stop to it. And you should see her
drying her hair and helping Plunket to roll the
tennis-courts&mdash;that hair of hers blowing like gold flames, and
her sleeves rolled to her arm-pits!&mdash;and you should see her
down in the dirt playing marbles with Billy and
Drina&mdash;shooting away excitedly and exclaiming 'fen-dubs!' and
'knuckle-down, Billy!'&mdash;like any gamin you ever heard of.
Totally unspoiled, Phil!&mdash;in spite of all the success of her
first winter!&mdash;and do you know that she had no end of men
seriously entangled? I don't mind your knowing&mdash;but Sudbury
Gray came to me, and I told him he'd better wait, but in he
blundered and&mdash;he's done for, now; and so are my plans. He's
an imbecile! And then, who on earth do you think came waddling into
the arena? Percy Draymore! Phil, it was an anxious problem for
me&mdash;and although I didn't really want Eileen to marry into
that set&mdash;still&mdash;with the Draymores' position and
tremendous influence&mdash;But she merely stared at him in cold
astonishment. And there were others, too, callow for the most part.
. . . Phil?"</p>
<p>"What?" he said, laughing.</p>
<p>His sister regarded him smilingly, then partly turned around and
perched herself on the padded arm of a great chair.</p>
<p>"Phil, <i>am</i> I garrulous?"</p>
<p>"No, dear; you are far too reticent."</p>
<p>"Pooh! Suppose I do talk a great deal. I like to. Besides, I
always have something interesting to say, don't I?"</p>
<p>"Always!"</p>
<p>"Well, then, why do you look at me so humorously out of those
nice gray eyes? . . . Phil, you are growing handsome! Do you know
it?"</p>
<p>"For Heaven's sake!" he protested, red and uncomfortable, "what
utter nonsense you&mdash;"</p>
<p>"Of course it bores you to be told so; and you look so
delightfully ashamed&mdash;like a reproved setter-puppy! Well,
then, don't laugh at my loquacity again!&mdash;because I'm going to
say something else. . . . Come over here, Phil; no&mdash;close to
me. I wish to put my hands on your shoulders; like that. Now look
at me! Do you really love me?"</p>
<p>"Sure thing, Ninette."</p>
<p>"And you know I adore you; don't you?"</p>
<p>"Madly, dear, but I forgive you."</p>
<p>"No; I want you to be serious. Because I'm pretty serious. See,
I'm not smiling now; I don't feel like it. Because it is a very,
very important matter, Phil&mdash;this thing that
has&mdash;has&mdash;almost happened. . . . It's about Eileen. . . .
And it really has happened."</p>
<p>"What has she done?" he asked curiously.</p>
<p>His sister's eyes were searching his very diligently, as though
in quest of something elusive; and he gazed serenely back, the most
unsuspicious of smiles touching his mouth.</p>
<p>"Phil, dear, a young girl&mdash;a very young girl&mdash;is a
vapid and uninteresting proposition to a man of thirty-five; isn't
she?"</p>
<p>"Rather&mdash;in some ways."</p>
<p>"In what way is she not?"</p>
<p>"Well&mdash;to me, for example&mdash;she is acceptable as
children are acceptable&mdash;a blessed, sweet, clean relief from
the women of the Fanes' set, for example?"</p>
<p>"Like Rosamund?"</p>
<p>"Yes. And, Ninette, you and Austin seem to be drifting out of
the old circles&mdash;the sort that you and I were accustomed to.
You don't mind my saying it, do you?&mdash;but there were so many
people in this town who had something besides
millions&mdash;amusing, well-bred, jolly people who had no end of
good times, but who didn't gamble and guzzle and stuff themselves
and their friends&mdash;who were not eternally hanging around other
people's wives. Where are they, dear?"</p>
<p>"If you are indicting all of my friends, Phil&mdash;"</p>
<p>"I don't mean all of your friends&mdash;only a small
proportion&mdash;which, however, connects your circle with that
deadly, idle, brainless bunch&mdash;the insolent chatterers at the
opera, the gorged dowagers, the worn-out, passionless men, the
enervated matrons of the summer capital, the chlorotic squatters on
huge yachts, the speed-mad fugitives from the furies of ennui, the
neurotic victims of mental cirrhosis, the jewelled animals whose
moral code is the code of the barnyard&mdash;!"</p>
<p>"Philip!"</p>
<p>"Oh, I don't mean that they are any more vicious than the idle
and mentally incompetent in any walk of life. East Side, West Side,
Harlem, Hell's Kitchen, Fifth Avenue, Avenue A, and Abingdon
Square&mdash;the denizens are only locally different, not
specifically&mdash;the species remains unchanged. But everywhere,
in every quarter and class and set and circle there is always the
depraved; and the logical links that connect them are unbroken from
Fifth Avenue to Chinatown, from the half-crazed extravagances of
the Orchils' Louis XIV ball to a New Year's reception at the
Haymarket where Troy Lil's diamonds outshine the phony pearls of
Hoboken Fanny, and Hatpin Molly leads the spiel with Clarence the
Pig."</p>
<p>"Phil, you are too disgusting!"</p>
<p>"I'm sorry&mdash;it isn't very nice of me, I suppose. But, dear,
I'm dead tired of moral squalor. I do like the brightness of
things, too, but I don't care for the phosphorescence of social
decay."</p>
<p>"What in the world is the matter?" she exclaimed in dismay. "You
are talking like the wildest socialist."</p>
<p>He laughed. "We have become a nation of what you call
'socialists'&mdash;though there are other names for us which mean
more. I am not discontented, if that is what you mean; I am only
impatient; and there is a difference. . . . And you have just asked
me whether a young girl is interesting to me. I answer, yes, thank
God!&mdash;for the cleaner, saner, happier hours I have spent this
winter among my own kind have been spent where the younger set
dominated.</p>
<p>"They are good for us, Nina; they are the hope of our own
kind&mdash;well-taught, well-drilled, wholesome even when negative
in mind; and they come into our world so diffident yet so
charmingly eager, so finished yet so unspoiled, that&mdash;how can
they fail to touch a man and key him to his best? How can they fail
to arouse in us the best of sympathy, of chivalry, of anxious
solicitude lest they become some day as we are and stare at life
out of the faded eyes of knowledge!"</p>
<p>He laid his hands in hers, smiling a little at his own
earnestness.</p>
<p>"Alarmist? No! The younger set are better than those who bred
them; and if, in time, they, too, fall short, they will not fall as
far as their parents. And, in their turn, when they look around
them at the younger set whom they have taught in the light and
wisdom of their own shortcomings, they will see fresher, sweeter,
lovelier young people than we see now. And it will continue so,
dear, through the jolly generations. Life is all right, only, like
art, it is very, very long sometimes."</p>
<p>"Good out of evil, Phil?" asked his sister, smiling; "innocence
from the hotbeds of profligacy? purity out of vulgarity? sanity
from hideous ostentation? Is that what you come preaching?"</p>
<p>"Yes; and isn't it curious! Look at that old harridan, Mrs.
Sanxon Orchil! There are no more innocent and charming girls in
Manhattan than her daughters. She <i>knew</i> enough to make them
different; so does the majority of that sort. Look at the Cardwell
girl and the Innis girl and the Craig girl! Look at Mrs.
Delmour-Carnes's children! And, Nina&mdash;even Molly Hatpin's
wastrel waif shall never learn what her mother knows if Destiny
will help Madame Molly ever so little. And I think that Destiny is
often very kind&mdash;even to the Hatpin offspring."</p>
<p>Nina sat silent on the padded arm of her chair, looking up at
her brother.</p>
<p>"Mad preacher! Mad Mullah!&mdash;dear, dear fellow!" she said
tenderly; "all ills of the world canst thou discount, but not thine
own."</p>
<p>"Those, too," he insisted, laughing; "I had a talk with
Boots&mdash;but, anyway, I'd already arrived at my own conclusion
that&mdash;that&mdash;I'm rather overdoing this blighted
business&mdash;"</p>
<p>"Phil!"&mdash;in quick delight.</p>
<p>"Yes," he said, reddening nicely; "between you and Boots and
myself I've decided that I'm going in for&mdash;for whatever any
man is going in for&mdash;life! Ninette, life to the full and up to
the hilt for mine!&mdash;not side-stepping anything. . . . Because
I&mdash;because, Nina, it's shameful for a man to admit to himself
that he cannot make good, no matter how thoroughly he's been
hammered to the ropes. And so I'm starting out again&mdash;not
hunting trouble like him of La Mancha&mdash;but, like him in this,
that I shall not avoid it. . . . Is <i>that</i> plain to you,
little sister?"</p>
<p>"Yes, oh, yes, it is!" she murmured; "I am so happy, so
proud&mdash;but I knew it was in your blood, Phil; I knew that you
were merely hurt and stunned&mdash;badly hurt, but not
fatally!&mdash;you could not be; no weaklings come from our
race."</p>
<p>"But still our race has always been law-abiding&mdash;observant
of civil and religious law. If I make myself free again, I take
some laws into my own hands.".</p>
<p>"How do you mean?" she asked.</p>
<p>"Well," he said grimly, "for example, I am forbidden, in some
States, to marry again&mdash;"</p>
<p>"But you <i>know</i> there was no reason for <i>that</i>!"</p>
<p>"Yes, I do happen to know; but still I am taking the liberty of
disregarding the law if I do. Then, what clergyman, of our faith,
would marry me to anybody?"</p>
<p>"That, too, you know is not just, Phil. You were innocent of
wrong-doing; you were chivalrous enough to make no
defence&mdash;"</p>
<p>"Wrong-doing? Nina, I was such a fool that I was innocent of
sense enough to do either good or evil. Yet I did do harm; there
never was such a thing as a harmless fool. But all I can do is to
go and sin no more; yet there is little merit in good conduct if
one hides in a hole too small to admit temptation. No; there are
laws civil and laws ecclesiastical; and sometimes I think a man is
justified in repealing the form and retaining the substance of
them, and remoulding it for purposes of self-government; as I do,
now. . . . Once, oppressed by form and theory, I told you that to
remarry after divorce was a slap at civilisation. . . . Which is
true sometimes and sometimes not. Common sense, not laws, must
govern a man in that matter. But if any motive except desire to be
a decent citizen sways a self-punished man toward self-leniency,
then is he unpardonable if he breaks those laws which truly were
fashioned for such as he!"</p>
<p>"Saint Simon! Saint Simon! Will you please arise, stretch your
limbs, and descend from your pillar?" said Nina; "because I am
going to say something that is very, very serious; and very near my
heart."</p>
<p>"I remember," he said; "it's about Eileen, isn't it?"</p>
<p>"Yes, it is about Eileen."</p>
<p>He waited; and again his sister's eyes began restlessly
searching his for something that she seemed unable to find.</p>
<p>"You make it a little difficult, Phil; I don't believe I had
better speak of it."</p>
<p>"Why not?"</p>
<p>"Why, just because you ask me 'why not?' for example."</p>
<p>"Is it anything that worries you about Eileen?"</p>
<p>"N-no; not exactly. It is&mdash;it may be a phase; and yet I
know that if it is anything at all it is not a passing phase. She
is different from the majority, you see&mdash;very intelligent,
very direct. She never forgets&mdash;for example. Her loyalty is
quite remarkable, Phil. She is very intense in her&mdash;her
beliefs&mdash;the more so because she is unusually free from
impulse&mdash;even quite ignorant of the deeper emotions; or so I
believed until&mdash;until&mdash;"</p>
<p>"Is she in <i>love</i>?" he asked.</p>
<p>"A little, Phil."</p>
<p>"Does she admit it?" he demanded, unpleasantly astonished.</p>
<p>"She admits it in a dozen innocent ways to me who can understand
her; but to herself she has not admitted it, I think&mdash;could
not admit it yet; because&mdash;because&mdash;"</p>
<p>"Who is it?" asked Selwyn; and there was in his voice the
slightest undertone of a growl.</p>
<p>"Dear, shall I tell you?"</p>
<p>"Why not?"</p>
<p>"Because&mdash;because&mdash;Phil, I think that our pretty
Eileen is a little in love with&mdash;you."</p>
<p>He straightened out to his full height, scarlet to the temples;
she dropped her linked fingers in her lap, gazing at him almost
sadly.</p>
<p>"Dear, all the things you are preparing to shout at me are quite
useless; I <i>know</i>; I don't imagine, I don't forestall, I don't
predict. I am not discounting any hopes of mine, because, Phil, I
had not thought&mdash;had not planned such a thing&mdash;between
you and Eileen&mdash;I don't know why. But I had not; there was
Suddy Gray&mdash;a nice boy, perfectly qualified; and there were
alternates more worldly, perhaps. But I did not think of you; and
that is what now amazes and humiliates me; because it was the
obvious that I overlooked&mdash;the most perfectly
natural&mdash;"</p>
<p>"Nina! you are madder than a March heiress!"</p>
<p>"Air your theories, Phil, then come back to realities. The
conditions remain; Eileen is certainly a little in love with you;
and a little with her means something. And you, evidently, have
never harboured any serious intentions toward the child; I can see
that, because you are the most transparent man I ever knew. Now,
the question is, what is to be done?"</p>
<p>"Done? Good heavens! Nothing, of course! There's nothing to do
anything about! Nina, you are the most credulous little matchmaker
that ever&mdash;"</p>
<p>"Oh, Phil, <i>must</i> I listen to all those fulminations before
you come down to the plain fact? And it's plain to me as the nose
on your countenance; and I don't know what to do about it! I
certainly was a perfect fool to confide in you, for you are
exhibiting the coolness and sagacity of a stampeded chicken."</p>
<p>He laughed in spite of himself; then, realising a little what
her confidence had meant, he turned a richer red and slowly lifted
his fingers to his moustache, while his perplexed gray eyes began
to narrow as though sun-dazzled.</p>
<p>"I am, of course, obliged to believe that you are mistaken," he
said; "a man cannot choose but believe in that manner. . . . There
is no very young girl&mdash;nobody, old or young, whom I like as
thoroughly as I do Eileen Erroll. She knows it; so do you, Nina. It
is open and above-board. . . . I should be very unhappy if anything
marred or distorted our friendship. . . . I am quite confident that
nothing will."</p>
<p>"In that frame of mind," said his sister, smiling, "you are the
healthiest companion in the world for her, for you will either cure
her, or she you; and it is all right either way."</p>
<p>"Certainly it will be all right," he said confidently.</p>
<p>For a few moments he paced the room, reflective, quickening his
pace all the while; and his sister watched him, silent in her
indecision.</p>
<p>"I'm going up to see the kids," he said abruptly.</p>
<p>The children, one and all, were in the Park; but Eileen was
sewing in the nursery, and his sister did not call him back as he
swung out of the room and up the stairs. But when he had
disappeared, Nina dropped into her chair, aware that she had played
her best card prematurely; forced by Rosamund, who had just told
her that rumour continued to be very busy coupling her brother's
name with the name of the woman who once had been his wife.</p>
<p>Nina was now thoroughly convinced of Alixe's unusual capacity
for making mischief.</p>
<p>She had known Alixe always&mdash;and she had seen her develop
from a talented, restless, erratic, emotional girl, easily moved to
generosity, into an impulsive woman, reckless to the point of
ruthlessness when ennui and unhappiness stampeded her; a woman not
deliberately selfish, not wittingly immoral, for she lacked the
passion which her emotion was sometimes mistaken for; and she was
kind by instinct.</p>
<p>Sufficiently intelligent to suffer from the lack of it in
others, cultured to the point of recognising culture, her dangerous
unsoundness lay in her utter lack of mental stamina when conditions
became unpleasant beyond her will, not her ability to endure
them.</p>
<p>The consequences of her own errors she refused to be burdened
with; to escape somehow, was her paramount impulse, and she always
tried to&mdash;had always attempted it even in
school-days&mdash;and farther back when Nina first remembered her
as a thin, eager, restless little girl scampering from one scrape
into another at full speed. Even in those days there were moments
when Nina believed her to be actually irrational, but there was
every reason not to say so to the heedless scatterbrain whose
father, in the prime of life, sat all day in his room, his faded
eyes fixed wistfully on the childish toys which his attendant
brought to him from his daughter's nursery.</p>
<p>All this Nina was remembering; and again she wondered bitterly
at Alixe's treatment of her brother, and what explanation there
could ever be for it&mdash;except one.</p>
<p>Lately, too, Alixe had scarcely been at pains to conceal her
contempt for her husband, if what Rosamund related was true. It was
only one more headlong scrape, this second marriage, and Nina knew
Alixe well enough to expect the usual stampede toward that gay
phantom which was always beckoning onward to promised
happiness&mdash;that goal of heart's desire already lying so far
behind her&mdash;and farther still for every step her little flying
feet were taking in the oldest, the vainest, the most hopeless
chase in the world&mdash;the headlong hunt for happiness.</p>
<p>And if that blind hunt should lead once more toward Selwyn?
Suppose, freed from Ruthven, she turned in her tracks and threw
herself and her youthful unhappiness straight at the man who had
not yet destroyed the picture that Nina found when she visited her
brother's rooms with the desire to be good to him with
rocking-chairs!</p>
<p>Not that she really believed or feared that Philip would
consider such an impossible reconciliation; pride, and a sense of
the absurd, must always check any such weird caprice of her
brother's conscience; and yet&mdash;and yet other amazing and
mismated couples had done it&mdash;had been reunited.</p>
<p>And Nina was mightily troubled, for Alixe's capacity for
mischief was boundless; and that she, in some manner, had already
succeeded in stirring up Philip, was a rumour that persisted and
would not be annihilated.</p>
<p>To inform a man frankly that a young girl is a little in love
with him is one of the oldest, simplest, and easiest methods of
interesting that man&mdash;unless he happen to be in love with
somebody else. And Nina had taken her chances that the picture of
Alixe was already too unimportant for the ceremony of incineration.
Besides, what she had ventured to say to him was her belief; the
child appeared to be utterly absorbed in her increasing intimacy
with Selwyn. She talked of little else; her theme was
Selwyn&mdash;his influence on Gerald, and her delight in his
companionship. They had, at his suggestion, taken up together the
study of Cretan antiquities&mdash;a sort of tender pilgrimage for
her, because, with the aid of her father's and mother's letters,
note-books, and papers, she and Selwyn were following on the map
the journeys and discoveries of her father.</p>
<p>But this was not all; Nina's watchful eyes opened wider and
wider as she witnessed in Eileen the naissance of an unconscious
and delicate coquetry, quite unabashed, yet the more significant
for that; and Nina, intent on the new phenomena, began to divine
more about Eileen in a single second, than the girl could have
suspected of herself in a month of introspection and of prayer.</p>
<p>Love was not there; Nina understood that; but its germ
was&mdash;still dormant, but bedded deliciously in congenial
soil&mdash;the living germ in all its latent promise, ready to
swell with the first sudden heart-beat, quicken with the first
quickening of the pulse, unfold into perfect symmetry if ever the
warm, even current in the veins grew swift and hot under the first
scorching whisper of Truth.</p>
<hr style='width: 45%;' />
<p>Eileen, sewing by the nursery window, looked up; her little
Alsatian maid, cross-legged on the floor at her feet, sewing away
diligently, also looked up, then scrambled to her feet as Selwyn
halted on the threshold of the room.</p>
<p>"Why, how odd you look!" said Eileen, laughing: "come in,
please; Susanne and I are only mending some of my summer things.
Were you in search of the children?&mdash;don't say so if you were,
because I'm quite happy in believing that you knew I was here. Did
you?"</p>
<p>"Where are the children?" he asked.</p>
<p>"In the Park, my very rude friend. You will find them on the
Mall if you start at once."</p>
<p>He hesitated, but finally seated himself, omitting the little
formal hand-shake with which they always met, even after an hour's
separation. Of course she noticed this, and, bending low above her
sewing, wondered why.</p>
<p>It seemed to him, for a moment, as though he were looking at a
woman he had heard about and had just met for the first time. His
observation of her now was leisurely, calm, and thorough&mdash;not
so calm, however, when, impatient of his reticence, bending there
over her work, she raised her dark-blue eyes to his, her head
remaining lowered. The sweet, silent inspection lasted but a
moment, then she resumed her stitches, aware that something in him
had changed since she last had seen him; but she merely smiled
quietly to herself, confident of his unaltered devotion in spite of
the strangely hard and unresponsive gaze that had uneasily evaded
hers.</p>
<p>As her white fingers flew with the glimmering needle she
reflected on conditions as she had left them a week ago. A week
ago, between him and her the most perfect of understandings
existed; and the consciousness of it she had carried with her every
moment in the country&mdash;amid the icy tumble of the surf, on
long vigorous walks over the greening hills where wild moorland
winds whipped like a million fairy switches till the young blood
fairly sang, pouring through her veins.</p>
<p>Since that&mdash;some time within the week, <i>something</i>
evidently had happened to him, here in the city while she had been
away. What?</p>
<p>As she bent above the fine linen garment on her knee, needle
flying, a sudden memory stirred coldly&mdash;the recollection of
her ride with Rosamund; and instinctively her clear eyes flew open
and she raised her head, turning directly toward him a disturbed
gaze he did not this time evade.</p>
<p>In silence their regard lingered; then, satisfied, she smiled
again, saying: "Have I been away so long that we must begin all
over, Captain Selwyn?"</p>
<p>"Begin what, Eileen?"</p>
<p>"To remember that the silence of selfish preoccupation is a
privilege I have not accorded you?"</p>
<p>"I didn't mean to be preoccupied&mdash;"</p>
<p>"Oh, worse and worse!" She shook her head and began to thread
the needle. "I see that my week's absence has not been very good
for you. I knew it the moment you came in with all that guilty
absent-minded effrontery which I have forbidden. Now, I suppose I
shall have to recommence your subjection. Ring for tea, please.
And, Susanne"&mdash;speaking in French and gathering up a fluffy
heap of mended summer waists&mdash;"these might as well be sent to
the laundress&mdash;thank you, little one; your sewing is always
beautiful."</p>
<p>The small maid, blushing with pleasure, left the room, both arms
full of feminine apparel; Selwyn rang for tea, then strolled back
to the window, where he stood with both hands thrust into his
coat-pockets, staring out at the sunset.</p>
<p>A primrose light bathed the city. Below, through the new foliage
of the Park, the little lake reflected it in tints of deeper gold
and amber where children clustered together, sailing toy ships. But
there was no wind; the tiny sails and flags hung motionless, and
out and in, among the craft becalmed, steered a family of wild
ducks, the downy yellow fledglings darting hither and thither in
chase of gnats, the mother bird following in leisurely
solicitude.</p>
<p>And, as he stood there, absently intent on sky and roof and
foliage, her soft bantering voice aroused him; and turning he found
her beside him, her humorous eyes fixed on his face.</p>
<p>"Suppose," she said, "that we go back to first principles and
resume life properly by shaking hands. Shall we?"</p>
<p>He coloured up as he took her hand in his; then they both
laughed at the very vigorous shake.</p>
<p>"What a horribly unfriendly creature you <i>can</i> be," she
said. "Never a greeting, never even a formal expression of pleasure
at my return&mdash;"</p>
<p>"You have not <i>returned</i>!" he said, smiling; "you have been
with me every moment, Eileen."</p>
<p>"What a pretty tribute!" she exclaimed; "I am beginning to
recognise traces of my training after all. And it is high time,
Captain Selwyn, because I was half convinced that you had escaped
to the woods again. What, if you please, have you been doing in
town since I paroled you? Nothing? Oh, it's very likely. You're
probably too ashamed to tell me. Now note the difference between
us; <i>I</i> have been madly tearing over turf and dune, up hills,
down hillocks, along headlands, shores, and shingle; and I had the
happiness of being half-frozen in the surf before Nina learned of
it and stopped me. . . . Come; sit over here; because I'm quite
crazy to tell you everything as usual&mdash;about how I played
marbles with the children&mdash;yes, indeed!&mdash;down on my knees
and shooting hard! Oh, it is divine, that sea-girdled,
wind-drenched waste of moor and thicket!&mdash;the strange little
stunted forests in the hollows of the miniature hills&mdash;do you
remember? The trees, you know, grow only to the wind-level, then
spread out like those grotesque trees in fairy-haunted
forests&mdash;so old, so fantastic are these curious patches of
woods that I am for ever watching to see something magic moving far
in the twilight of the trees! . . . And one night I went out on the
moors; oh, heavenly! celestial!&mdash;under the stretch of stars!
Elf-land in silence, save for the bewitched wind. And the fairy
forests drew me toward their edges, down, down into the hollow,
with delicious shivers.</p>
<p>"Once I trembled indeed, for the starlight on the swamp was
suddenly splintered into millions of flashes; and my heart leaped
in pure fright! . . . It was only a wild duck whirring headlong
into the woodland waters&mdash;but oh, if you had been there to see
the weird beauty of its coming&mdash;and the star-splashed
blackness! You <i>must</i> see that with me, some time. . . . When
are you coming to Silverside? We go back very soon, now. . . . And
I don't feel at all like permitting you to run wild in town when
I'm away and playing hopscotch on the lawn with Drina!"</p>
<p>She lay back in her chair, laughing, her hands linked together
behind her head.</p>
<p>"Really, Captain Selwyn, I confess I missed you. It's much
better fun when two can see all those things that I saw&mdash;the
wild roses just a tangle of slender green-mossed stems, the new
grass so intensely green, with a touch of metallic iridescence; the
cat's-paws chasing each other across the purple inland
ponds&mdash;and that cheeky red fox that came trotting out of the
briers near Wonder Head, and, when he saw me, coolly attempted to
stare me out of countenance! Oh, it's all very well to tell you
about it, but there is a little something lacking in unshared
pleasures. . . . Yes, a great deal lacking. . . . And here is our
tea-tray at last."</p>
<p>Nina came up to join them. Her brother winced as she smiled
triumphantly at him, and the colour continued vivid in his face
while she remained in the room. Then the children charged upstairs,
fresh from the Park, clamouring for food; and they fell upon
Selwyn's neck, and disarranged his scarf-pin, and begged for
buttered toast and crumpets, and got what they demanded before
Nina's authority could prevent.</p>
<p>"I saw a rabbit at Silverside!" said Billy, "but do you know,
Uncle Philip, that hunting pack of ours is no good! Not one dog
paid any attention to the rabbit though Drina and I did our
best&mdash;didn't we, Drina?"</p>
<p>"You should have seen them," murmured Eileen, leaning close to
whisper to Selwyn; "the children had fits when the rabbit came
hopping across the road out of the Hither Woods. But the dogs all
ran madly the other way, and I thought Billy would die of
mortification."</p>
<p>Nina stood up, waving a crumpet which she had just rescued from
Winthrop. "Hark!" she said, "there's the nursery curfew!&mdash;and
not one wretched infant bathed! Billy! March bathward, my son!
Drina, sweetheart, take command. Prune souffl&eacute; for the
obedient, dry bread for rebels! Come, children!&mdash;don't let
mother speak to you twice."</p>
<p>"Let's go down to the library," said Eileen to Selwyn&mdash;"you
are dining with us, of course. . . . What? Yes, indeed, you are.
The idea of your attempting to escape to some dreadful club and
talk man-talk all the evening when I have not begun to tell you
what I did at Silverside!"</p>
<p>They left the nursery together and descended the stairs to the
library. Austin had just come in, and he looked up from his
solitary cup of tea as they entered:</p>
<p>"Hello, youngsters! What conspiracy are you up to now? I suppose
you sniffed the tea and have come to deprive me. By the way, Phil,
I hear that you've sprung the trap on those Siowitha people."</p>
<p>"Neergard has, I believe."</p>
<p>"Well, isn't it all one?"</p>
<p>"No, it is not!" retorted Selwyn so bluntly that Eileen turned
from the window at a sound in his voice which she had never before
heard.</p>
<p>"Oh!" Austin stared over his suspended teacup, then drained it.
"Trouble with our friend Julius?" he inquired.</p>
<p>"No trouble. I merely severed my connection with him."</p>
<p>"Ah! When?"</p>
<p>"This morning."</p>
<p>"In that case," said Austin, laughing, "I've a job for
you&mdash;"</p>
<p>"No, old fellow; and thank you with all my heart. I've half made
up my mind to live on my income for a while and take up that
Chaosite matter again&mdash;"</p>
<p>"And blow yourself to smithereens! Why spatter Nature thus?"</p>
<p>"No fear," said Selwyn, laughing. "And, if it promises anything,
I may come to you for advice on how to start it commercially."</p>
<p>"If it doesn't start you heavenward you shall have my advice
from a safe distance. I'll telegraph it," said Austin. "But, if
it's not personal, why on earth have you shaken Neergard?"</p>
<p>And Selwyn answered simply: "I don't like him. That is the
reason, Austin."</p>
<p>The children from the head of the stairs were now shouting
demands for their father; and Austin rose, pretending to
grumble:</p>
<p>"Those confounded kids! A man is never permitted a moment to
himself. Is Nina up there, Eileen! Oh, all right. Excuses et
cetera; I'll be back pretty soon. You'll stay to dine, Phil?"</p>
<p>"I don't think so&mdash;"</p>
<p>"Yes, he will stay," said Eileen calmly.</p>
<p>And, when Austin had gone, she walked swiftly over to where
Selwyn was standing, and looked him directly in the eyes.</p>
<p>"Is all well with Gerald?"</p>
<p>"Y-yes, I suppose so."</p>
<p>"Is he still with Neergard &amp; Co.?"</p>
<p>"Yes, Eileen."</p>
<p>"And <i>you</i> don't like Mr. Neergard?"</p>
<p>"N-no."</p>
<p>"Then Gerald must not remain."</p>
<p>He said very quietly: "Eileen, Gerald no longer takes me into
his confidence. I am afraid&mdash;I know, in fact&mdash;that I have
little influence with him now. I am sorry; it hurts; but your
brother is his own master, and he is at liberty to choose his own
friends and his own business policy. I cannot influence him; I have
learned that thoroughly. Better that I retain what real friendship
he has left for me than destroy it by any attempt, however gentle,
to interfere in his affairs."</p>
<p>She stood before him, straight, slender, her face grave and
troubled.</p>
<p>"I cannot understand," she said, "how he could refuse to listen
to a man like you."</p>
<p>"A man like me, Eileen? Well, if I were worth listening to, no
doubt he'd listen. But the fact remains that I have not been able
to hold his interest&mdash;"</p>
<p>"Don't give him up," she said, still looking straight into his
eyes. "If you care for me, don't give him up."</p>
<p>"Care for you, Eileen! You know I do."</p>
<p>"Yes, I know it. So you will not give up Gerald, will you? He
is&mdash;is only a boy&mdash;you know that; you know he has
been&mdash;perhaps&mdash;indiscreet. But Gerald is only a boy.
Stand by him, Captain Selwyn; because Austin does not know how to
manage him&mdash;really he doesn't. . . . There has been another
unpleasant scene between them; Gerald told me."</p>
<p>"Did he tell you why, Eileen?"</p>
<p>"Yes. He told me that he had played cards for money, and he was
in debt. I know that sounds&mdash;almost disgraceful; but is not
his need of help all the greater?"</p>
<p>Selwyn's eyes suddenly narrowed: "Did <i>you</i> help him out,
this time?"</p>
<p>"I&mdash;I&mdash;how do you mean, Captain Selwyn?" But the
splendid colour in her face confirmed his certainty that she had
used her own resources to help her brother pay the gambling debt;
and he turned away his eyes, angry and silent.</p>
<p>"Yes," she said under her breath, "I did aid him. What of it?
Could I refuse?"</p>
<p>"I know. Don't aid him again&mdash;<i>that</i> way."</p>
<p>She stared: "You mean&mdash;"</p>
<p>"Send him to me, child. I understand such matters; I&mdash;that
is&mdash;" and in sudden exasperation inexplicable, for the moment,
to them both: "Don't touch such matters again! They soil, I tell
you. I will not have Gerald go to you about such things!"</p>
<p>"My own brother! What do you mean?"</p>
<p>"I mean that, brother or not, he shall not bring such matters
near you!"</p>
<p>"Am I to count for nothing, then, when Gerald is in trouble?"
she demanded, flushing up.</p>
<p>"Count! Count!" he repeated impatiently; "of course you count!
Good heavens! it's women like you who count&mdash;and no
others&mdash;not one single other sort is of the slightest
consequence in the world or to it. Count? Child, you control us
all; everything of human goodness, of human hope hinges and hangs
on you&mdash;is made possible, inevitable, because of you! And you
ask me whether you count! You, who control us all, and always
will&mdash;as long as you are you!"</p>
<p>She had turned a little pale under his vehemence, watching him
out of wide and beautiful eyes.</p>
<p>What she understood&mdash;how much of his incoherence she was
able to translate, is a question; but in his eyes and voice there
was something simpler to divine; and she stood very still while his
roused emotions swept her till her heart leaped up and every vein
in her ran fiery pride.</p>
<p>"I am&mdash;overwhelmed . . . I did not consider that I
counted&mdash;so vitally&mdash;in the scheme of things. But I must
try to&mdash;if you believe all this of me&mdash;only you must
teach me how to count for something in the world. Will you?"</p>
<p>"Teach you, Eileen. What winning mockery! <i>I</i> teach
<i>you</i>? Well, then&mdash;I teach you this&mdash;that a man's
blunder is best healed by a man's sympathy; . . . I will stand by
Gerald as long as he will let me do so&mdash;not alone for your
sake, nor only for his, but for my own. I promise you that. Are you
contented?"</p>
<p>"Yes."</p>
<p>She slowly raised one hand, laying it fearlessly in both of
his.</p>
<p>"He is all I have left," she said. "You know that."</p>
<p>"I know, child."</p>
<p>"Then&mdash;thank you, Captain Selwyn."</p>
<p>"No; I thank you for giving me this charge. It means that a man
must raise his own standard of living before he can accept such
responsibility. . . . You endow me with all that a man ought to be;
and my task is doubled; for it is not only Gerald but I myself who
require surveillance."</p>
<p>He looked up, smilingly serious: "Such women as you alone can
fit your brother and me for an endless guard duty over the white
standard you have planted on the outer walls of the world."</p>
<p>"You say things to me&mdash;sometimes&mdash;" she faltered,
"that almost hurt with the pleasure they give."</p>
<p>"Did that give you pleasure?"</p>
<p>"Y-yes; the surprise of it was almost too&mdash;too keen. I wish
you would not&mdash;but I am glad you did. . . . You
see"&mdash;dropping into a great velvet chair&mdash;"having been of
no serious consequence to anybody for so many years&mdash;to be
told, suddenly, that I&mdash;that I count so vitally with
men&mdash;a man like you&mdash;"</p>
<p>She sank back, drew one small hand across her eyes, and rested a
moment; then leaning forward, she set her elbow on one knee and
bracketed her chin between forefinger and thumb.</p>
<p>"<i>You</i> don't know," she said, smiling faintly, "but, oh,
the exalted dreams young girls indulge in! And one and all centre
around some power-inspired attitude of our own when a great crisis
comes. And most of all we dream of counting heavily; and more than
all we clothe ourselves in the celestial authority which dares to
forgive. . . . Is it not pathetically amusing&mdash;the mental
process of a young girl?&mdash;and the paramount theme of her dream
is power!&mdash;such power as will permit the renunciation of
vengeance; such power as will justify the happiness of forgiving? .
. . And every dream of hers is a dream of power; and, often, the
happiness of forbearing to wield it. All dreams lead to it, all
mean it; for instance, half-awake, then faintly conscious in
slumber, I lie dreaming of power&mdash;always power; the triumph of
attainment, of desire for wisdom and knowledge satisfied. I dream
of friendships&mdash;wonderful intimacies exquisitely satisfying; I
dream of troubles, and my moral power to sweep them out of
existence; I dream of self-sacrifice, and of the spiritual power to
endure it; I dream&mdash;I dream&mdash;sometimes&mdash;of more
material power&mdash;of splendours and imposing estates, of a
paradise all my own. And when I have been selfishly happy long
enough, I dream of a vast material power fitting me to wipe poverty
from the world; I plan it out in splendid generalities, sometimes
in minute detail. . . . Of men, we naturally dream; but vaguely, in
a curious and confused way. . . . Once, when I was fourteen, I saw
a volunteer regiment passing; and it halted for a while in front of
our house; and a brilliant being on a black horse turned lazily in
his saddle and glanced up at our window. . . . Captain Selwyn, it
is quite useless for you to imagine what fairy scenes, what
wondrous perils, what happy adventures that gilt-corded adjutant
and I went through in my dreams. Marry him? Indeed I did, scores of
times. Rescue him? Regularly. He was wounded, he was attacked by
fevers unnumbered, he fled in peril of his life, he vegetated in
countless prisons, he was misunderstood, he was a martyr to
suspicion, he was falsely accused, falsely condemned. And then,
just before the worst occurred, <i>I</i> appear!&mdash;the
inevitable I."</p>
<p>She dropped back into the chair, laughing. Her colour was high,
her eyes brilliant; she laid her arms along the velvet arms of the
chair and looked at him.</p>
<p>"I've not had you to talk to for a whole week," she said; "and
you'll let me; won't you? I can't help it, anyway, because as soon
as I see you&mdash;crack! a million thoughts wake up in me and
clipper-clapper goes my tongue. . . . You are very good for me. You
are so thoroughly satisfactory&mdash;except when your eyes narrow
in that dreadful far-away gaze&mdash;which I've forbidden, you
understand. . . . <i>What</i> have you done to your moustache?"</p>
<p>"Clipped it."</p>
<p>"Oh, I don't like it too short. Can you get hold of it to pull
it? It's the only thing that helps you in perplexity to solve
problems. You'd be utterly helpless, mentally, without your
moustache. . . . When are we to take up our Etruscan symbols
again?&mdash;or was it Evans's monograph we were laboriously
dissecting? Certainly it was; don't you remember the Hittite
hieroglyph of Jerabis?&mdash;and how you and I fought over those
wretched floral symbols? You don't? And it was only a week ago? . .
. And listen! Down at Silverside I've been reading the most
delicious thing&mdash;the Mimes of Herodas!&mdash;oh, so charmingly
quaint, so perfectly human, that it seems impossible that they were
written two thousand years ago. There's a maid, in one scene,
Threissa, who is precisely like anybody's maid&mdash;and an old
lady, Gyllis&mdash;perfectly human, and not Greek, but Yankee of
to-day! Shall we reread it together?&mdash;when you come down to
stay with us at Silverside?"</p>
<p>"Indeed we shall," he said, smiling; "which also reminds
me&mdash;"</p>
<p>He drew from his breast-pocket a thin, flat box, turned it round
and round, glanced at her, balancing it teasingly in the palm of
his hand.</p>
<p>"Is it for me? Really? Oh, please don't be provoking! Is it
<i>really</i> for me? Then give it to me this instant!"</p>

<b>"Turning, looked straight at Selwyn."</b>
<br /></div>
<p>He dropped the box into the pink hollow of her supplicating
palms. For a moment she was very busy with the tissue-paper;
then:</p>
<p>"Oh! it is perfectly sweet of you!" turning the small book bound
in heavy Etruscan gold; "whatever can it be?" and, rising, she
opened it, stepping to the window so that she could see.</p>
<p>Within, the pages were closely covered with the minute, careful
handwriting of her father; it was the first note-book he ever kept;
and Selwyn had had it bound for her in gold.</p>
<p>For an instant she gazed, breathless, lips parted; then slowly
she placed the yellowed pages against her lips and, turning, looked
straight at Selwyn, the splendour of her young eyes starred with
tears.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_VII" id="CHAPTER_VII"></a>CHAPTER VII</h2>
<h3>ERRANDS AND LETTERS</h3>
<p>Alixe Ruthven had not yet dared tell Selwyn that her visit to
his rooms was known to her husband. Sooner or later she meant to
tell him; it was only fair to him that he should be prepared for
anything that might happen; but as yet, though her first instinct,
born of sheer fright, urged her to seek instant council with
Selwyn, fear of him was greater than the alarm caused her by her
husband's knowledge.</p>
<p>She was now afraid of her husband's malice, afraid of Selwyn's
opinion, afraid of herself most of all, for she understood herself
well enough to realise that, if conditions became intolerable, the
first and easiest course out of it would be the course she'd
take&mdash;wherever it led, whatever it cost, or whoever was
involved.</p>
<p>In addition to her dread and excitement, she was deeply
chagrined and unhappy; and, although Jack Ruthven did not again
refer to the matter&mdash;indeed appeared to have forgotten
it&mdash;her alarm and humiliation remained complete, for Gerald
now came and played and went as he chose; and in her disconcerted
cowardice she dared not do more than plead with Gerald in secret,
until she began to find the emotion consequent upon such intimacy
unwise for them both.</p>
<p>Neergard, too, was becoming a familiar figure in her
drawing-room; and, though at first she detested him, his patience
and unfailing good spirits, and his unconcealed admiration for her
softened her manner toward him to the point of toleration.</p>
<p>And Neergard, from his equivocal footing in the house of
Ruthven, obtained another no less precarious in the house of
Fane&mdash;all in the beginning on a purely gaming basis. However,
Gerald had already proposed him for the Stuyvesant and Proscenium
clubs; and, furthermore, a stormy discussion was now in progress
among the members of the famous Siowitha over an amazing
proposition from their treasurer, Jack Ruthven.</p>
<p>This proposal was nothing less than to admit Neergard to
membership in that wealthy and exclusive country club, as a choice
of the lesser evil; for it appeared, according to Ruthven, that
Neergard, if admitted, was willing to restore to the club, free of
rent, the thousands of acres vitally necessary to the club's
existence as a game preserve, merely retaining the title to these
lands for himself.</p>
<p>Draymore was incensed at the proposal, Harmon, Orchil, and Fane
were disgustedly non-committal, but Phoenix Mottly was perhaps the
angriest man on Long Island.</p>
<p>"In the name of decency, Jack," he said, "what are you dreaming
of? Is it not enough that this man, Neergard, holds us up once? Do
I understand that he has the impudence to do it again with your
connivance? Are you going to let him sandbag us into electing him?
Is that the sort of hold-up you stand for? Well, then, I tell you
I'll never vote for him. I'd rather see these lakes and streams of
ours dry up; I'd rather see the last pheasant snared and the last
covey leave for the other end of the island, than buy off that
Dutchman with a certificate of membership in the Siowitha!"</p>
<p>"In that case," retorted Ruthven, "we'd better wind up our
affairs and make arrangements for an auctioneer."</p>
<p>"All right; wind up and be damned!" said Mottly; "there'll be at
least sufficient self-respect left in the treasury to go
round."</p>
<p>Which was all very fine, and Mottly meant it at the time; but,
outside of the asset of self-respect, there was too much money
invested in the lands, plant, and buildings, in the streams, lakes,
hatcheries, and forests of the Siowitha. The enormously wealthy
seldom stand long upon dignity if that dignity is going to be very
expensive. Only the poor can afford disastrous self-respect.</p>
<p>So the chances were that Neergard would become a
member&mdash;which was why he had acquired the tract&mdash;and the
price he would have to pay was not only in taxes upon the acreage,
but, secretly, a solid sum in addition to little Mr. Ruthven whom
he was binding to him by every tie he could pay for.</p>
<p>Neergard did not regret the expense. He had long since
discounted the cost; and he also continued to lose money at the
card-table to those who could do him the most good.</p>
<p>Away somewhere in the back of his round, squat, busy head he had
an inkling that some day he would even matters with some people.
Meanwhile he was patient, good-humoured, amusing when given a
chance, and, as the few people he knew found out, inventive and
resourceful in suggesting new methods of time-killing to any
wealthy and fashionable victim of a vacant mind.</p>
<p>And as this faculty has always been the real key to the inner
Temple of the Ten Thousand Disenchantments, the entrance of Mr.
Neergard appeared to be only a matter of time and opportunity, and
his ultimate welcome at the naked altar a conclusion foregone.</p>
<p>In the interim, however, he suffered Gerald and little Ruthven
to pilot him; he remained cheerfully oblivious to the snubs and
indifference accorded him by Mrs. Ruthven, Mrs. Fane, and others of
their entourage whom he encountered over the card-tables or at
card-suppers. And all the while he was attending to his business
with an energy and activity that ought to have shamed Gerald, and
did, at times, particularly when he arrived at the office utterly
unfit for the work before him.</p>
<p>But Neergard continued astonishingly tolerant and kind, lending
him money, advancing him what he required, taking up or renewing
notes for him, until the boy, heavily in his debt, plunged more
heavily still in sheer desperation, only to flounder the deeper at
every struggle to extricate himself.</p>
<p>Alixe Ruthven suspected something of this, but it was useless as
well as perilous in other ways for her to argue with Gerald, for
the boy had come to a point where even his devotion to her could
not stop him. He <i>must</i> go on. He did not say so to Alixe; he
merely laughed, assuring her that he was all right; that he knew
how much he could afford to lose, and that he would stop when his
limit was in sight. Alas, he had passed his limit long since; and
already it was so far behind him that he dared not look
back&mdash;dared no longer even look forward.</p>
<p>Meanwhile the Ruthvens were living almost lavishly, and keeping
four more horses; but Eileen Erroll's bank balance had now dwindled
to three figures; and Gerald had not only acted offensively toward
Selwyn, but had quarrelled so violently with Austin that the
latter, thoroughly incensed and disgusted, threatened to forbid him
the house.</p>
<p>"The little fool!" he said to Selwyn, "came here last night,
stinking of wine, and attempted to lay down the law to
me!&mdash;tried to dragoon me into a compromise with him over the
investments I have made for him. By God, Phil, he shall not control
one cent until the trust conditions are fulfilled, though it was
left to my discretion, too. And I told him so flatly; I told him he
wasn't fit to be trusted with the coupons of a repudiated South
American bond&mdash;"</p>
<p>"Hold on, Austin. That isn't the way to tackle a boy like
that!"</p>
<p>"Isn't it? Well, why not? Do you expect me to dicker with
him?"</p>
<p>"No; but, Austin, you've always been a little brusque with him.
Don't you think&mdash;"</p>
<p>"No, I don't. It's discipline he needs, and he'll get it good
and plenty every time he comes here."</p>
<p>"I&mdash;I'm afraid he may cease coming here. That's the worst
of it. For his sister's sake I think we ought to try to put up
with&mdash;"</p>
<p>"Put up! Put up! I've been doing nothing else since he came of
age. He's turned out a fool of a puppy, I tell you; he's idle,
lazy, dissipated, impudent, conceited, insufferable&mdash;"</p>
<p>"But not vicious, Austin, and not untruthful. Where his
affections are centred he is always generous; where they should be
centred he is merely thoughtless, not deliberately
selfish&mdash;"</p>
<p>"See here, Phil, how much good has your molly-coddling done him?
You warned him to be cautious in his intimacy with Neergard, and he
was actually insulting to you&mdash;"</p>
<p>"I know; but I understood. He probably had some vague idea of
loyalty to a man whom he had known longer than he knew me. That was
all; that was what I feared, too. But it had to be done&mdash;I was
determined to venture it; and it seems I accomplished nothing. But
don't think that Gerald's attitude toward me makes any difference,
Austin. It doesn't; I'm just as devoted to the boy, just as sorry
for him, just as ready to step in when the chance comes, as it
surely will, Austin. He's only running a bit wilder than the usual
colt; it takes longer to catch and bridle him&mdash;"</p>
<p>"Somebody'll rope him pretty roughly before you run him down,"
said Gerard.</p>
<p>"I hope not. Of course it's a chance he takes, and we can't help
it; but I'm trying to believe he'll tire out in time and come back
to us for his salt. And, Austin, we've simply got to believe in
him, you know&mdash;on Eileen's account."</p>
<p>Austin grew angrier and redder:</p>
<p>"Eileen's account? Do you mean her bank account? It's easy
enough to believe in him if you inspect his sister's bank account.
Believe in him? Oh, certainly I do; I believe he's pup enough to
come sneaking to his sister to pay for all the damfooleries he's
engaged in. . . . And I've positively forbidden her to draw another
check to his order&mdash;"</p>
<p>"It's that little bangled whelp, Ruthven," said Selwyn between
his teeth. "I warned Gerald most solemnly of that man, but&mdash;"
He shrugged his shoulders and glanced about him at the
linen-covered furniture and bare floors. After a moment he looked
up: "The game there is of course notorious. I&mdash;if matters did
not stand as they do"&mdash;he flushed painfully&mdash;"I'd go
straight to Ruthven and find out whether or not this business could
be stopped."</p>
<p>"Stopped? No, it can't be. How are you going to stop a man from
playing cards in his own house? They all do it&mdash;that sort.
Fane's rather notorious himself; they call his house the house of
ill-Fane, you know. If you or I or any of our family were on any
kind of terms with the Ruthvens, they might exclude Gerald to
oblige us. We are not, however; and, anyway, if Gerald means to
make a gambler and a souse of himself at twenty-one, he'll do it.
But it's pretty rough on us."</p>
<p>"It's rougher on him, Austin; and it's roughest on his sister.
Well"&mdash;he held out his hand&mdash;"good-bye. No, thanks, I
won't stop to see Nina and Eileen; I'm going to try to think up
some way out of this. And&mdash;if Gerald comes to you
again&mdash;try another tack&mdash;just try it. You know, old
fellow, that, between ourselves, you and I are sometimes short of
temper and long of admonition. Let's try reversing the combination
with Gerald."</p>
<p>But Austin only growled from the depths of his linen-shrouded
arm-chair, and Selwyn turned away, wondering what in the world he
could do in a matter already far beyond the jurisdiction of either
Austin or himself.</p>
<p>If Alixe had done her best to keep Gerald away, she appeared to
be quite powerless in the matter; and it was therefore useless to
go to her. Besides, he had every inclination to avoid her. He had
learned his lesson.</p>
<p>To whom then could he go? Through whom could he reach Gerald?
Through Nina? Useless. And Gerald had already defied Austin.
Through Neergard, then? But he was on no terms with Neergard; how
could he go to him? Through Rosamund Fane? At the thought he made a
wry face. Any advances from him she would wilfully misinterpret.
And Ruthven? How on earth could he bring himself to approach
him?</p>
<p>And the problem therefore remained as it was; the only chance of
any solution apparently depending upon these friends of Gerald's,
not one of whom was a friend of Selwyn; indeed some among them were
indifferent to the verge of open enmity.</p>
<p>And yet he had promised Eileen to do what he could. What merit
lay in performing an easy obligation? What courage was required to
keep a promise easily kept? If he cared anything for her&mdash;if
he really cared for Gerald, he owed them more than effortless
fulfilment. And here there could be no fulfilment without effort,
without the discarding from self of the last rags of pride. And
even then, what hope was there&mdash;after the sacrifice of self
and the disregard of almost certain humiliation?</p>
<p>It was horribly hard for him; there seemed to be no chance in
sight. But forlorn hope was slowly rousing the soldier in
him&mdash;the grim, dogged, desperate necessity of doing his duty
to the full and of leaving consequences to that Destiny, which some
call by a name more reverent.</p>
<p>So first of all, when at length he had decided, he nerved
himself to strike straight at the centre; and within the hour he
found Gerald at the Stuyvesant Club.</p>
<p>The boy descended to the visitors' rooms, Selwyn's card in his
hand and distrust written on every feature. And at Selwyn's first
frank and friendly words he reddened to the temples and checked
him.</p>
<p>"I won't listen," he said. "They&mdash;Austin and&mdash;and
everybody have been putting you up to this until I'm tired of it.
Do they think I'm a baby? Do they suppose I don't know enough to
take care of myself? Are they trying to make me ridiculous? I tell
you they'd better let me alone. My friends are my friends, and I
won't listen to any criticism of them, and that settles it."</p>
<p>"Gerald&mdash;"</p>
<p>"Oh, I know perfectly well that you dislike Neergard. I don't,
and that's the difference."</p>
<p>"I'm not speaking of Mr. Neergard, Gerald; I'm only trying to
tell you what this man Ruthven really is doing&mdash;"</p>
<p>"What do I care what he is doing!" cried Gerald angrily. "And,
anyway, it isn't likely I'd come to you to find out anything about
Mrs. Ruthven's second husband!"</p>
<p>Selwyn rose, very white and still. After a moment he drew a
quiet breath, his clinched hands relaxed, and he picked up his hat
and gloves.</p>
<p>"They are my friends," muttered Gerald, as pale as he. "You
drove me into speaking that way."</p>
<p>"Perhaps I did, my boy. . . . I don't judge you. . . . If you
ever find you need help, come to me; and if you can't come, and
still need me, send for me. I'll do what I can&mdash;always. I know
you better than you know yourself. Good-bye."</p>
<p>He turned to the door; and Gerald burst out: "Why can't you let
my friends alone? I liked you before you began this sort of
thing!"</p>
<p>"I will let them alone if you will," said Selwyn, halting. "I
can't stand by and see you exploited and used and perverted. Will
you give me one chance to talk it over, Gerald?"</p>
<p>"No, I wont!" returned Gerald hotly; "I'll stand for my friends
every time! There's no treachery in me!"</p>
<p>"You are not standing by me very fast," said the elder man
gently.</p>
<p>"I said I was standing by my <i>friends</i>!" repeated the
boy.</p>
<p>"Very well, Gerald; but it's at the expense of your own people,
I'm afraid."</p>
<p>"That's my business, and you're not one of 'em!" retorted the
boy, infuriated; "and you won't be, either, if I can prevent it, no
matter whether people say that you're engaged to her&mdash;"</p>
<p>"What!" whispered Selwyn, wheeling like a flash. The last
vestige of colour had fled from his face; and Gerald caught his
breath, almost blinded by the blaze of fury in the elder man's
eyes.</p>
<p>Neither spoke again; and after a moment Selwyn's eyes fell, he
turned heavily on his heel and walked away, head bent, gray eyes
narrowing to slits.</p>
<p>Yet, through the brain's chaos and the heart's loud tumult and
the clamour of pulses run wild at the insult flung into his very
face, the grim instinct to go on persisted. And he went on, and on,
for <i>her</i> sake&mdash;on&mdash;he knew not how&mdash;until he
came to Neergard's apartment in one of the vast West-Side
constructions, bearing the name of a sovereign state; and here,
after an interval, he followed his card to Neergard's splendid
suite, where a man-servant received him and left him seated by a
sunny window overlooking the blossoming foliage of the Park.</p>
<p>When Neergard came in, and stood on the farther side of a big
oak table, Selwyn rose, returning the cool, curt nod.</p>
<p>"Mr. Neergard," he said, "it is not easy for me to come here
after what I said to you when I severed my connection with your
firm. You have every reason to be unfriendly toward me; but I came
on the chance that whatever resentment you may feel will not
prevent you from hearing me out."</p>
<p>"Personal resentment," said Neergard slowly, "never interferes
with my business. I take it, of course, that you have called upon a
business matter. Will you sit down?"</p>
<p>"Thank you; I have only a moment. And what I am here for is to
ask you, as Mr. Erroll's friend, to use your influence on Mr.
Erroll&mdash;every atom of your influence&mdash;to prevent him from
ruining himself financially through his excesses. I ask you, for
his family's sake, to discountenance any more gambling; to hold him
strictly to his duties in your office, to overlook no more
shortcomings of his, but to demand from him what any trained
business man demands of his associates as well as of his employees.
I ask this for the boy's sake."</p>
<p>Neergard's close-set eyes focussed a trifle closer to Selwyn's,
yet did not meet them.</p>
<p>"Mr. Selwyn," he said, "have you come here to criticise the
conduct of my business?"</p>
<p>"Criticise! No, I have not. I merely ask you&mdash;"</p>
<p>"You are merely asking me," cut in Neergard, "to run my office,
my clerks, and my associate in business after some theory of your
own."</p>
<p>Selwyn looked at the man and knew he had lost; yet he forced
himself to go on:</p>
<p>"The boy regards you as his friend. Could you not, as his
friend, discourage his increasing tendency toward
dissipation&mdash;"</p>
<p>"I am not aware that he is dissipated."</p>
<p>"What!"</p>
<p>"I say that I am not aware that Gerald requires any interference
from me&mdash;or from you, either," said Neergard coolly. "And as
far as that goes, I and my business require no interference either.
And I believe that settles it."</p>
<p>He touched a button; the man-servant appeared to usher Selwyn
out.</p>
<p>The latter set his teeth in his under lip and looked straight
and hard at Neergard, but Neergard thrust both hands in his
pockets, turned squarely on his heel, and sauntered out of the
room, yawning as he went.</p>
<p>It bid fair to become a hard day for Selwyn; he foresaw it, for
there was more for him to do, and the day was far from ended, and
his self-restraint was nearly exhausted!</p>
<p>An hour later he sent his card in to Rosamund Fane; and Rosamund
came down, presently, mystified, flattered, yet shrewdly alert and
prepared for anything since the miracle of his coming justified
such preparation.</p>
<p>"Why in the world," she said with a flushed gaiety perfectly
genuine, "did you ever come to see <i>me</i>? Will you please sit
here, rather near me?&mdash;or I shall not dare believe that you
are that same Captain Selwyn who once was so deliciously rude to me
at the Minster's dance."</p>
<p>"Was there not a little malice&mdash;just a very little&mdash;on
your part to begin it?" he asked, smiling.</p>
<p>"Malice? Why? Just because I wanted to see how you and Alixe
Ruthven would behave when thrust into each other's arms? Oh,
Captain Selwyn&mdash;what a harmless little jest of mine to evoke
all that bitterness you so smilingly poured out on me! . . . But I
forgave you; I'll forgive you more than that&mdash;if you ask me.
Do you know"&mdash;and she laid her small head on one side and
smiled at him out of her pretty doll's eyes&mdash;"do you know that
there are very few things I might not be persuaded to pardon you?
Perhaps"&mdash;with laughing audacity&mdash;"there are not any at
all. Try, if you please."</p>
<p>"Then you surely will forgive me for what I have come to ask
you," he said lightly. "Won't you?"</p>
<p>"Yes," she said, her pink-and-white prettiness challenging him
from every delicate feature&mdash;"yes&mdash;I will pardon
you&mdash;on one condition."</p>
<p>"And what is that, Mrs. Fane?"</p>
<p>"That you are going to ask me something quite unpardonable!" she
said with a daring little laugh. "For if it's anything less
improper than an impropriety I won't forgive you. Besides, there'd
be nothing to forgive. So please begin, Captain Selwyn."</p>
<p>"It's only this," he said: "I am wondering whether you would do
anything for me?"</p>
<p>"<i>Any</i>thing! <i>Merci</i>! Isn't that extremely general,
Captain Selwyn? But you never can tell; ask me."</p>
<p>So he bent forward, his clasped hands between his knees, and
told her very earnestly of his fears about Gerald, asking her to
use her undoubted influence with the boy to shame him from the
card-tables, explaining how utterly disastrous to him and his
family his present course was.</p>
<p>"He is very fond of you, Mrs. Fane&mdash;and you know how easy
it is for a boy to be laughed out of excesses by a pretty woman of
experience. You see I am desperately put to it or I would never
have ventured to trouble you&mdash;"</p>
<p>"I see," she said, looking at him out of eyes bright with
disappointment.</p>
<p>"Could you help us, then?" he asked pleasantly.</p>
<p>"Help <i>us</i>, Captain Selwyn? Who is the 'us,' please?"</p>
<p>"Why, Gerald and me&mdash;and his family," he added, meeting her
eyes. The eyes began to dance with malice.</p>
<p>"His family," repeated Rosamund; "that is to say, his sister,
Miss Erroll. His family, I believe, ends there; does it not?"</p>
<p>"Yes, Mrs. Fane."</p>
<p>"I see. . . . Miss Erroll is naturally worried over him. But I
wonder why she did not come to me herself instead of sending you as
her errant ambassador?"</p>
<p>"Miss Erroll did not send me," he said, flushing up. And,
looking steadily into the smiling doll's face confronting him, he
knew again that he had failed.</p>
<p>"I am not inclined to be very much flattered after all," said
Rosamund. "You should have come on your own errand, Captain Selwyn,
if you expected a woman to listen to you. Did you not know
that?"</p>
<p>"It is not a question of errands or of flattery," he said
wearily; "I thought you might care to influence a boy who is headed
for serious trouble&mdash;that is all, Mrs. Fane."</p>
<p>She smiled: "Come to me on your <i>own</i> errand&mdash;for
Gerald's sake, for anybody's sake&mdash;for your own, preferably,
and I'll listen. But don't come to me on another woman's errands,
for I won't listen&mdash;even to you."</p>
<p>"I <i>have</i> come on my own errand!" he repeated coldly. "Miss
Erroll knew nothing about it, and shall not hear of it from me. Can
you not help me, Mrs. Fane?"</p>
<p>But Rosamund's rose-china features had hardened into a polished
smile; and Selwyn stood up, wearily, to make his adieux.</p>
<p>But, as he entered his hansom before the door, he knew the end
was not yet; and once more he set his face toward the impossible;
and once more the hansom rolled away over the asphalt, and once
more it stopped&mdash;this time before the house of Ruthven.</p>
<p>Every step he took now was taken through sheer force of
will&mdash;and in <i>her</i> service; because, had it been, now,
only for Gerald's sake, he knew he must have weakened&mdash;and
properly, perhaps, for a man owes something to himself. But what he
was now doing was for a young girl who trusted him with all the
fervour and faith of her heart and soul; and he could spare himself
in nowise if, in his turn, he responded heart and soul to the
solemn appeal.</p>
<p>Mr. Ruthven, it appeared, was at home and would receive Captain
Selwyn in his own apartment.</p>
<p>Which he did&mdash;after Selwyn had been seated for twenty
minutes&mdash;strolling in clad only in silken lounging clothes,
and belting about his waist, as he entered, the sash of a kimona,
stiff with gold.</p>
<p>His greeting was a pallid stare; but, as Selwyn made no motion
to rise, he lounged over to a couch and, half reclining among the
cushions, shot an insolent glance at Selwyn, then yawned and
examined the bangles on his wrist.</p>
<p>After a moment Selwyn said: "Mr. Ruthven, you are no doubt
surprised that I am here&mdash;"</p>
<p>"I'm not surprised if it's my wife you've come to see," drawled
Ruthven. "If I'm the object of your visit, I confess to some
surprise&mdash;as much as the visit is worth, and no more."</p>
<p>The vulgarity of the insult under the man's own roof scarcely
moved Selwyn to any deeper contempt, and certainly not to
anger.</p>
<p>"I did not come here to ask a favour of you," he said
coolly&mdash;"for that is out of the question, Mr. Ruthven. But I
came to tell you that Mr. Erroll's family has forbidden him to
continue his gambling in this house and in your company anywhere or
at any time."</p>
<p>"Most extraordinary," murmured Ruthven, passing his ringed
fingers over his minutely shaven face&mdash;that strange face of a
boy hardened by the depravity of ages.</p>
<p>"So I must request you," continued Selwyn, "to refuse him the
opportunity of gambling here. Will you do
it&mdash;voluntarily?"</p>
<p>"No."</p>
<p>"Then I shall use my judgment in the matter."</p>
<p>"And what may your judgment in the matter be?"</p>
<p>"I have not yet decided; for one thing I might enter a complaint
with the police that a boy is being morally and materially ruined
in your private gambling establishment."</p>
<p>"Is that a threat?"</p>
<p>"No. I will act, not threaten."</p>
<p>"Ah," drawled Ruthven, "I may do the same the next time my wife
spends the evening in your apartment."</p>
<p>"You lie," said Selwyn in a voice made low by surprise.</p>
<p>"Oh, no, I don't. Very chivalrous of you&mdash;quite proper for
you to deny it like a gentleman&mdash;but useless, quite useless.
So the less said about invoking the law, the better for&mdash;some
people. You'll agree with me, I dare say. . . . And now, concerning
your friend, Gerald Erroll&mdash;I have not the slightest desire to
see him play cards. Whether or not he plays is a matter perfectly
indifferent to me, and you had better understand it. But if you
come here demanding that I arrange my guest-lists to suit you, you
are losing time."</p>
<p>Selwyn, almost stunned at Ruthven's knowledge of the episode in
his rooms, had risen as he gave the man the lie direct.</p>
<p>For an instant, now, as he stared at him, there was murder in
his eye. Then the utter hopeless helplessness of his position
overwhelmed him, as Ruthven, with danger written all over him,
stood up, his soft smooth thumbs hooked in the glittering sash of
his kimona.</p>
<p>"Scowl if you like," he said, backing away instinctively, but
still nervously impertinent; "and keep your distance! If you've
anything further to say to me, write it." Then, growing bolder as
Selwyn made no offensive move, "Write to me," he repeated with a
venomous smirk; "it's safer for you to figure as <i>my</i>
correspondent than as my wife's co-respondent&mdash;L-let go of me!
W-what the devil are you d-d-doing&mdash;"</p>
<p>For Selwyn had him fast&mdash;one sinewy hand twisted in his
silken collar, holding him squirming at arm's length.</p>
<p>"M-murder!" stammered Mr. Ruthven.</p>
<p>"No," said Selwyn, "not this time. But be very, very careful
after this."</p>
<p>And he let him go with an involuntary shudder, and wiped his
hands on his handkerchief.</p>
<p>Ruthven stood quite still; and after a moment the livid terror
died out in his face and a rushing flush spread over it&mdash;a
strange, dreadful shade, curiously opaque; and he half turned,
dizzily, hands outstretched for self-support.</p>
<p>Selwyn coolly watched him as he sank on to the couch and sat
huddled together and leaning forward, his soft, ringed fingers
covering his impurpled face.</p>
<p>Then Selwyn went away with a shrug of utter loathing; but after
he had gone, and Ruthven's servants had discovered him and summoned
a physician, their master lay heavily amid his painted draperies
and cushions, his congested features set, his eyes partly open and
possessing sight, but the whites of them had disappeared and the
eyes themselves, save for the pupils, were like two dark slits
filled with blood.</p>
<p>There was no doubt about it; the doctors, one and all, knew
their business when they had so often cautioned Mr. Ruthven to
avoid sudden and excessive emotions.</p>
<p>That night Selwyn wrote briefly to Mrs. Ruthven:</p>
<div class="blockquot">
<p>"I saw your husband this afternoon. He is at liberty to inform
you of what passed. But in case he does not, there is one detail
which you ought to know: your husband believes that you once paid a
visit to my apartments. It is unlikely that he will repeat the
accusation and I think there is no occasion for you to worry.
However, it is only proper that you should know this&mdash;which is
my only excuse for writing you a letter that requires no
acknowledgment. Very truly yours,</p>
<p>"PHILIP SELWYN."</p>
</div>
<p>To this letter she wrote an excited and somewhat incoherent
reply; and rereading it in troubled surprise, he began to recognise
in it something of the strange, illogical, impulsive attitude which
had confronted him in the first weeks of his wedded life.</p>
<p>Here was the same minor undertone of unrest sounding ominously
through every line; the same illogical, unhappy attitude which
implied so much and said so little, leaving him uneasy and
disconcerted, conscious of the vague recklessness and veiled
reproach&mdash;dragging him back from the present through the dead
years to confront once more the old pain, the old bewilderment at
the hopeless misunderstanding between them.</p>
<p>He wrote in answer:</p>
<div class="blockquot">
<p>"For the first time in my life I am going to write you some
unpleasant truths. I cannot comprehend what you have written; I
cannot interpret what you evidently imagine I must divine in these
pages&mdash;yet, as I read, striving to understand, all the old
familiar pain returns&mdash;the hopeless attempt to realise wherein
I failed in what you expected of me.</p>
<p>"But how can I, now, be held responsible for your unhappiness
and unrest&mdash;for the malicious attitude, as you call it, of the
world toward you? Years ago you felt that there existed some occult
coalition against you, and that I was either privy to it or
indifferent. I was not indifferent, but I did not believe there
existed any reason for your suspicions. This was the beginning of
my failure to understand you; I was sensible enough that we were
unhappy, yet could not see any reason for it&mdash;could see no
reason for the increasing restlessness and discontent which came
over you like successive waves following some brief happy interval
when your gaiety and beauty and wit fairly dazzled me and everybody
who came near you. And then, always hateful and irresistible,
followed the days of depression, of incomprehensible impulses, of
that strange unreasoning resentment toward me.</p>
<p>"What could I do? I don't for a moment say that there was
nothing I might have done. Certainly there must have been
something; but I did not know what. And often in my confusion and
bewilderment I was quick-tempered, impatient to the point of
exasperation&mdash;so utterly unable was I to understand wherein I
was failing to make you contented.</p>
<p>"Of course I could not shirk or avoid field duty or any of the
details which so constantly took me away from you. Also I began to
understand your impatience of garrison life, of the monotony of the
place, of the climate, of the people. But all this, which I could
not help, did not account for those dreadful days together when I
could see that every minute was widening the breach between us.</p>
<p>"Alixe&mdash;your letter has brought it all back, vivid,
distressing, exasperating; and this time I <i>know</i> that I could
have done nothing to render you unhappy, because the time when I
was responsible for such matters is past.</p>
<p>"And this&mdash;forgive me if I say it&mdash;arouses a doubt in
me&mdash;the first honest doubt I have had of my own unshared
culpability. Perhaps after all a little more was due from you than
what you brought to our partnership&mdash;a little more patience, a
little more appreciation of my own inexperience and of my efforts
to make you happy. You were, perhaps, unwittingly
exacting&mdash;even a little bit selfish. And those sudden,
impulsive caprices for a change of environment&mdash;an escape from
the familiar&mdash;were they not rather hard on me who could do
nothing&mdash;who had no choice in the matter of obedience to my
superiors?</p>
<p>"Again and again I asked you to go to some decent climate and
wait for me until I could get leave. I stood ready and willing to
make any arrangement for you, and you made no decision.</p>
<p>"Then when Barnard's command moved out we had our last
distressing interview. And, if that night I spoke of your present
husband and asked you to be a little wiser and use a little more
discretion to avoid malicious comment&mdash;it was not because I
dreamed of distrusting you&mdash;it was merely for your own
guidance and because you had so often complained of other people's
gossip about you.</p>
<p>"To say I was stunned, crushed, when I learned of what had
happened in my absence, is to repeat a trite phrase. What it cost
me is of no consequence now; what it is now costing you I cannot
help.</p>
<p>"Yet, your letter, in every line, seems to imply some strange
responsibility on my part for what you speak of as the degrading
position you now occupy.</p>
<p>"Degradation or not&mdash;let us leave that aside; you cannot
now avoid being his wife. But as for any hostile attitude of
society in your regard&mdash;any league or coalition to discredit
you&mdash;that is not apparent to me. Nor can it occur if your
personal attitude toward the world is correct. Discretion and
circumspection, a happy, confident confronting of life&mdash;these,
and a wise recognition of conditions, constitute sufficient
safeguard for a woman in your delicately balanced position.</p>
<p>"And now, one thing more. You ask me to meet you at Sherry's for
a conference. I don't care to, Alixe. There is nothing to be said
except what can be written on letter-paper. And I can see neither
the necessity nor the wisdom of our writing any more letters."</p>
</div>
<p>For a few days no reply came; then he received such a strange,
unhappy, and desperate letter, that, astonished, alarmed, and
apprehensive, he went straight to his sister, who had run up to
town for the day from Silverside, and who had telephoned him to
take her somewhere for luncheon.</p>
<p>Nina appeared very gay and happy and youthful in her spring
plumage, but she exclaimed impatiently at his tired and careworn
pallor; and when a little later they were seated
t&ecirc;te-&agrave;-t&ecirc;te in the rococo dining-room of a
popular French restaurant, she began to urge him to return with
her, insisting that a week-end at Silverside was what he needed to
avert physical disintegration.</p>
<p>"What is there to keep you in town?" she demanded, breaking bits
from the stick of crisp bread. "The children have been clamouring
for you day and night, and Eileen has been expecting a
letter&mdash;You promised to write her, Phil&mdash;!"</p>
<p>"I'm going to write to her," he said impatiently; "wait a
moment, Nina&mdash;don't speak of anything pleasant or&mdash;or
intimate just now&mdash;because&mdash;because I've got to bring up
another matter&mdash;something not very pleasant to me or to you.
May I begin?"</p>
<p>"What is it, Phil?" she asked, her quick, curious eyes intent on
his troubled face.</p>
<p>"It is about&mdash;Alixe."</p>
<p>"What about her?" returned his sister calmly.</p>
<p>"You knew her in school&mdash;years ago. You have always known
her&mdash;"</p>
<p>"Yes."</p>
<p>"You&mdash;did you ever visit her?&mdash;stay at the Varians'
house?"</p>
<p>"Yes."</p>
<p>"In&mdash;in her own home in Westchester?"</p>
<p>"Yes."</p>
<p>There was a silence; his eyes shifted to his plate; remained
fixed as he said:</p>
<p>"Then you knew her&mdash;father?"</p>
<p>"Yes, Phil," she said quietly, "I knew Mr. Varian."</p>
<p>"Was there anything&mdash;anything unusual&mdash;about
him&mdash;in those days?"</p>
<p>"Have you heard that for the first time?" asked his sister.</p>
<p>He looked up: "Yes. What was it, Nina?"</p>
<p>She became busy with her plate for a while; he sat rigid,
patient, one hand resting on his claret-glass. And presently she
said without meeting his eyes:</p>
<p>"It was even farther back&mdash;her grandparents&mdash;one of
them&mdash;" She lifted her head slowly&mdash;"That is why it so
deeply concerned us, Phil, when we heard of your marriage."</p>
<p>"What concerned you?"</p>
<p>"The chance of inheritance&mdash;the risk of the taint&mdash;of
transmitting it. Her father's erratic brilliancy became more than
eccentricity before I knew him. I would have told you that had I
dreamed that you ever could have thought of marrying Alixe Varian.
But how could I know you would meet her out there in the Orient! It
was&mdash;your cable to us was like a thunderbolt. . . . And when
she&mdash;she left you so suddenly&mdash;Phil, dear&mdash;I
<i>feared</i> the true reason&mdash;the only possible reason that
could be responsible for such an insane act."</p>
<p>"What was the truth about her father?" he said doggedly. "He was
eccentric; was he ever worse than that?"</p>
<p>"The truth was that he became mentally irresponsible before his
death."</p>
<p>"You <i>know</i> this?"</p>
<p>"Alixe told me when we were schoolgirls. And for days she was
haunted with the fear of what might one day be her inheritance.
That is all I know, Phil."</p>
<p>He nodded and for a while made some pretence of eating, but
presently leaned back and looked at his sister out of dazed
eyes.</p>
<p>"Do you suppose," he said heavily, "that <i>she</i> was not
entirely responsible when&mdash;when she went away?"</p>
<p>"I have wondered," said Nina simply. "Austin believes it."</p>
<p>"But&mdash;but&mdash;how in God's name could that be possible?
She was so brilliant&mdash;so witty, so charmingly and capriciously
normal&mdash;"</p>
<p>"Her father was brilliant and popular&mdash;when he was young.
Austin knew him, Phil. I have often, often wondered whether Alixe
realises what she is about. Her restless impulses, her intervals of
curious resentment&mdash;so many things which I remember and which,
now, I cannot believe were entirely normal. . . . It is a dreadful
surmise to make about anybody so youthful, so pretty, so
lovable&mdash;and yet, it is the kindest way to account for her
strange treatment of you&mdash;"</p>
<p>"I can't believe it," he said, staring at vacancy. "I refuse
to." And, thinking of her last frightened and excited letter
imploring an interview with him and giving the startling reason:
"What a scoundrel that fellow Ruthven is," he said with a
shudder.</p>
<p>"Why, what has he&mdash;"</p>
<p>"Nothing. I can't discuss it, Nina&mdash;"</p>
<p>"Please tell me, Phil!"</p>
<p>"There is nothing to tell."</p>
<p>She said deliberately: "I hope there is not, Phil. Nor do I
credit any mischievous gossip which ventures to link my brother's
name with the name of Mrs. Ruthven."</p>
<p>He paid no heed to what she hinted, and he was still thinking of
Ruthven when he said: "The most contemptible and cowardly thing a
man can do is to fail a person dependent on him&mdash;when that
person is in prospective danger. The dependence, the threatened
helplessness <i>must</i> appeal to any man! How can he, then, fail
to stand by a person in trouble&mdash;a person linked to him by
every tie, every obligation. Why&mdash;why to fail at such a time
is dastardly&mdash;and to&mdash;to make a possible threatened
infirmity a reason for abandoning a woman is monstrous&mdash;!"</p>
<p>"Phil! I never for a moment supposed that even if you suspected
Alixe to be not perfectly responsible you would have abandoned
her&mdash;"</p>
<p>"<i>I?</i> Abandon <i>her!</i>" He laughed bitterly. "I was not
speaking of myself," he said. . . . And to himself he wondered:
"Was it <i>that</i>&mdash;after all? Is that the key to my dreadful
inability to understand? I cannot&mdash;I cannot accept it. I know
her; it was not that; it&mdash;it must not be!"</p>
<p>And that night he wrote to her:</p>
<div class="blockquot">
<p>"If he threatens you with divorce on such a ground he himself is
likely to be adjudged mentally unsound. It was a brutal, stupid
threat, nothing more; and his insult to your father's memory was
more brutal still. Don't be stampeded by such threats. Disprove
them by your calm self-control under provocation; disprove them by
your discretion and self-confidence. Give nobody a single possible
reason for gossip. And above all, Alixe, don't become worried and
morbid over anything you might dread as inheritance, for you are as
sound to-day as you were when I first met you; and you shall not
doubt that you could ever be anything else. Be the woman you can
be! Show the pluck and courage to make the very best out of life. I
have slowly learned to attempt it; and it is not difficult if you
convince yourself that it can be done."</p>
</div>
<p>To this she answered the next day:</p>
<div class="blockquot">
<p>"I will do my best. There is danger and treachery everywhere;
and if it becomes unendurable I shall put an end to it in one way
or another. As for his threat&mdash;incident on my admitting that I
did go to your room, and defying him to dare believe evil of me for
doing it&mdash;I can laugh at it now&mdash;though, when I wrote
you, I was terrified&mdash;remembering how mentally broken my
father was when he died.</p>
<p>"But, as you say, I <i>am</i> sound, body and mind. I
<i>know</i> it; I don't doubt it for one
moment&mdash;except&mdash;at long intervals when, apropos of
nothing, a faint sensation of dread comes creeping.</p>
<p>"But I am <i>sound</i>! I know it so absolutely that I sometimes
wonder at my own perfect sanity and understanding; and so clearly,
so faultlessly, so precisely does my mind work that&mdash;and this
I never told you&mdash;I am often and often able to detect mental
inadequacy in many people around me&mdash;the slightest deviation
from the normal, the least degree of mental instability. Phil, so
sensitive to extraneous impression is my mind that you would be
astonished to know how instantly perceptible to me is mental
degeneration in other people. And it would amaze you, too, if I
should tell you how many, many people you know are, in some degree,
more or less insane.</p>
<p>"But there is no use in going into such matters; all I meant to
convey to you was that I am not frightened now at any threat of
that sort from him.</p>
<p>"I don't know what passed between you and him; he won't tell me;
but I do know from the servants that he has been quite ill&mdash;I
was in Westchester that night&mdash;and that something happened to
his eyes&mdash;they were dreadful for a while. I imagine it has
something to do with veins and arteries; and it's understood that
he's to avoid sudden excitement.</p>
<p>"However, he's only serenely disagreeable to me now, and we see
almost nothing of one another except over the card-tables. Gerald
has been winning rather heavily, I am glad to say&mdash;glad, as
long as I cannot prevent him from playing. And yet I may be able to
accomplish that yet&mdash;in a roundabout way&mdash;because the
apple-visaged and hawk-beaked Mr. Neergard has apparently become my
slavish creature; quite infatuated. And as soon as I've fastened on
his collar, and made sure that Rosamund can't unhook it, I'll try
to make him shut down on Gerald's playing. This for your sake,
Phil&mdash;because you ask me. And because you must always stand
for all that is upright and good and manly in my eyes. Ah, Phil!
what a fool I was! And all, all my own fault, too.</p>
<p>"Alixe."</p>
</div>
<p>This ended the sudden eruption of correspondence; for he did not
reply to this letter, though in it he read enough to make him
gravely uneasy; and he fell, once more, into the habit of brooding,
from which both Boots Lansing and Eileen had almost weaned him.</p>
<p>Also he began to take long solitary walks in the Park when not
occupied in conferences with the representatives of the Lawn
Nitro-Powder Works&mdash;a company which had recently approached
him in behalf of his unperfected explosive, Chaosite.</p>
<p>This hermit life might have continued in town indefinitely had
he not, one morning, been surprised by a note from Eileen&mdash;the
first he had ever had from her.</p>
<p>It was only a very brief missive&mdash;piquant, amusing,
innocently audacious in closing&mdash;a mere reminder that he had
promised to write to her; and she ended it by asking him very
plainly whether he had not missed her, in terms so frank, so sweet,
so confident of his inevitable answer, that all the enchantment of
their delightful intimacy surged back in one quick tremor of
happiness, washing from his heart and soul the clinging, sordid,
evil things which were creeping closer, closer to torment and
overwhelm him.</p>
<p>And all that day he went about his business quite happily, her
letter in his pocket; and that night, taking a new pen and pen
holder, he laid out his very best letter-paper, and began the first
letter he had ever written to Eileen Erroll.</p>
<div class="blockquot">
<p>"DEAR EILEEN: I have your charming little note from Silverside
reminding me that I had promised to write you. But I needed no
reminder; you know that. Then why have I not written? I couldn't,
off-hand. And every day and evening except to-day and this evening
I have been in conference with Edgerton Lawn and other
representatives of the Lawn Nitro-Powder Company; and have come to
a sort of semi-agreement with them concerning a high explosive
called Chaosite, which they desire to control the sale of as soon
as I can control its tendency to misbehave. This I expect to do
this summer; and Austin has very kindly offered me a tiny cottage
out on the moors too far from anybody or anything to worry
people.</p>
<p>"I know you will be glad to hear that I have such attractive
business prospects in view. I dare say I shall scarcely know what
to do with my enormous profits a year or two hence. Have you any
suggestions?</p>
<p>"Meanwhile, however, your letter and its questions await
answers; and here they are:</p>
<p>"Yes, I saw Gerald once at his club and had a short talk with
him. He was apparently well. You should not feel so anxious about
him. He is very young, yet, but he comes from good stock. Sooner or
later he is bound to find himself; you must not doubt that. Also he
knows that he can always come to me when he wishes.</p>
<p>"No, I have not ridden in the Park since you and Nina and the
children went to Silverside. I walked there Sunday, and it was most
beautiful, especially through the Ramble. In his later years my
father was fond of walking there with me. That is one reason I go
there; he seems to be very near me when I stand under the familiar
trees or move along the flowering walks he loved so well. I wish
you had known him. It is curious how often this wish recurs to me;
and so persistent was it in the Park that lovely Sunday that, at
moments, it seemed as though we three were walking there
together&mdash;he and you and I&mdash;quite happy in the silence of
companionship which seemed not of yesterday but of years.</p>
<p>"It is rather a comforting faculty I have&mdash;this unconscious
companionship with the absent. Once I told you that you had been
with me while you supposed yourself to be at Silverside. Do you
remember? Now, here in the city, I walk with you constantly; and we
often keep pace together through crowded streets and avenues; and
in the quiet hours you are very often, seated not far from where I
sit. . . . If I turned around now&mdash;so real has been your
presence in my room to-night&mdash;that it seems as though I could
not help but surprise you here&mdash;just yonder on the edges of
the lamp glow&mdash;</p>
<p>"But I know you had rather remain at Silverside, so I won't turn
around and surprise you here in Manhattan town.</p>
<p>"And now your next question: Yes, Boots is well, and I will give
him Drina's love, and I will try my best to bring him to Silverside
when I come. Boots is still crazed with admiration for his house.
He has two cats, a housekeeper, and a jungle of shrubs and vines in
the back yard, which he plays the hose on; and he has also acquired
some really beautiful old rugs&mdash;a Herez which has all the
tints of a living sapphire, and a charming antique Shiraz, rose,
gold, and that rare old Persian blue. To mention symbols for a
moment, apropos of our archaeological readings together, Boots has
an antique Asia Minor rug in which I discovered not only the
Swastika, but also a fire-altar, a Rhodian lily border, and a
Mongolian motif which appears to resemble the cloud-band. It was
quite an Anatshair jumble in fact, very characteristic. We must
capture Nina some day and she and you and I will pay a visit to
Boots's rugs and study these old dyes and mystic symbols of the
East. Shall we?</p>
<p>"And now your last question. And I answer: Yes, I do miss
you&mdash;so badly that I often take refuge in summoning you in
spirit. The other day I had occasion to see Austin; and we sat in
the library where all the curtains are in linen bags and all the
furniture in overalls, and where the rugs are rolled in tarred
paper and the pictures are muffled in cheese-cloth.</p>
<p>"And after our conference had ended and I was on my way to the
hall below, suddenly on my ear, faint but clear, I heard your
voice, sweet as the odour of blossoms in an empty room. No&mdash;it
neither deceived nor startled me; I have often heard it before,
when you were nowhere near. And, that I may answer your question
more completely, I answer it again: Yes, I miss you; so that I hear
your voice through every silence; all voids are gay with it; there
are no lonely places where my steps pass, because you are always
near; no stillness through which your voice does not sound; no
unhappiness, no sordid cares which the memory of you does not make
easier to endure.</p>
<p>"Have I answered? And now, good-night. Gerald has just come in;
I hear him passing through the hall to his own apartments. So I'll
drop in for a smoke with him before I start to search for you in
dreamland. Good-night, Eileen. PHILIP SELWYN."</p>
</div>
<p>When he had finished, sealed, and stamped his letter he leaned
back in his chair, smiling to himself, still under the spell which
the thought of her so often now cast over him. Life and the world
were younger, cleaner, fresher; the charming energy of her physical
vigour and youth and beauty tinted all things with the splendid hue
of inspiration. But most of all it was the exquisite fastidiousness
of her thoughts that had begun to inthral him&mdash;that crystal
clear intelligence, so direct, so generous&mdash;the splendid
wholesome attitude toward life&mdash;and her dauntless faith in the
goodness of it.</p>
<p>Breathing deeply, he drew in the fragrance of her memory, and
the bitterness of things was dulled with every quiet
respiration.</p>
<p>He smiled again, too; how utterly had his sister mistaken their
frank companionship! How stupidly superfluous was it to pretend to
detect, in their comradeship, the commonplaces of
sentiment&mdash;as though such a girl as Eileen Erroll were of the
common self-conscious mould&mdash;as though in their cordial
understanding there was anything less simple than community of
taste and the mutual attraction of intelligence!</p>
<p>Then, the memory of what his sister had said drove the smile
from his face and he straightened up impatiently. Love! What
unfortunate hallucination had obsessed Nina to divine what did not
exist?&mdash;what need not exist? How could a woman like his sister
fall into such obvious error; how could she mistake such
transparent innocence, such visible freedom from motive in this
young girl's pure friendship for himself?</p>
<p>And, as for him, he had never thought of Eileen&mdash;he could
not bring himself to think of her so materially or sentimentally.
For, although he now understood that he had never known what love,
might be&mdash;its coarser mask, infatuation, he had learned to see
through; and, as that is all he had ever known concerning love, the
very hint of it had astonished and repelled him, as though the mere
suggestion had been a rudeness offered to this delicate and
delicious friendship blossoming into his life&mdash;a life he had
lately thought so barren and laid waste.</p>
<p>No, his sister was mistaken; but her mistake must not disturb
the blossoming of this unstained flower. Sufficient that Eileen and
he disdainfully ignore the trite interpretation those outside might
offer them unasked; sufficient that their confidence in one another
remain without motive other than the happiness of unembarrassed
people who find a pleasure in sharing an intelligent curiosity
concerning men and things and the world about them.</p>
<p>Thinking of these matters, lying back there in his desk chair,
he suddenly remembered that Gerald had come in. They had scarcely
seen one another since that unhappy meeting in the Stuyvesant Club;
and now, remembering what he had written to Eileen, he emerged with
a start from his contented dreaming, sobered by the prospect of
seeking Gerald.</p>
<p>For a moment or two he hesitated; but he had said in his letter
that he was going to do it; and now he rose, looked around for his
pipe, found it, filled and lighted it, and, throwing on his
dressing-gown, went out into the corridor, tying the tasselled
cords around his waist as he walked.</p>
<p>His first knock remaining unanswered, he knocked more sharply.
Then he heard from within the muffled creak of a bed, heavy steps
across the floor. The door opened with a jerk; Gerald stood there,
eyes swollen, hair in disorder, his collar crushed, and the white
evening tie unknotted and dangling over his soiled shirt-front.</p>
<p>"Hello," said Selwyn simply; "may I come in?"</p>
<p>The boy passed his hand across his eyes as though confused by
the light; then he turned and walked back toward the bed, still
rubbing his eyes, and sat down on the edge.</p>
<p>Selwyn closed the door and seated himself, apparently not
noticing Gerald's dishevelment.</p>
<p>"Thought I'd drop in for a good-night pipe," he said quietly.
"By the way, Gerald, I'm going down to Silverside next week. Nina
has asked Boots, too. Couldn't you fix it to come along with
us?"</p>
<p>"I don't know," said the boy in a low voice; "I'd like to."</p>
<p>"Good business! That will be fine! What you and I need is a good
stiff tramp across the moors, or a gallop, if you like. It's great
for mental cobwebs, and my brain is disgracefully unswept. By the
way, somebody said that you'd joined the Siowitha Club."</p>
<p>"Yes," said the boy listlessly.</p>
<p>"Well, you'll get some lively trout fishing there now. It's only
thirty miles from Silverside, you know&mdash;you can run over in
the motor very easily."</p>
<p>Gerald nodded, sitting silent, his handsome head supported in
both hands, his eyes on the floor.</p>
<p>That something was very wrong with him appeared plainly enough;
but Selwyn, touched to the heart and miserably apprehensive, dared
not question him, unasked.</p>
<p>And so they sat there for a while, Selwyn making what
conversation he could; and at length Gerald turned and dragged
himself across the bed, dropping his head back on the disordered
pillows.</p>
<p>"Go on," he said; "I'm listening."</p>
<p>So Selwyn continued his pleasant, inconsequential observations,
and Gerald lay with closed eyes, quite motionless, until, watching
him, Selwyn saw his hand was trembling where it lay clinched beside
him. And presently the boy turned his face to the wall.</p>
<p>Toward midnight Selwyn rose quietly, removed his unlighted pipe
from between his teeth, knocked the ashes from it, and pocketed it.
Then he walked to the bed and seated himself on the edge.</p>
<p>"What's the trouble, old man?" he asked coolly.</p>
<p>There was no answer. He placed his hand over Gerald's; the boy's
hand lay inert, then quivered and closed on Selwyn's
convulsively.</p>
<p>"That's right," said the elder man; "that's what I'm here
for&mdash;to stand by when you hoist signals. Go on."</p>
<p>The boy shook his head and buried it deeper in the pillow.</p>
<p>"Bad as that?" commented Selwyn quietly. "Well, what of it? I'm
standing by, I tell you. . . . That's right"&mdash;as Gerald broke
down, his body quivering under the spasm of soundless
grief&mdash;"that's the safety-valve working. Good business. Take
your time."</p>
<p>It took a long time; and Selwyn sat silent and motionless, his
whole arm numb from its position and Gerald's crushing grasp. And
at last, seeing that was the moment to speak:</p>
<p>"Now let's fix up this matter, Gerald. Come on!"</p>
<p>"Good heavens! h-how can it be f-fixed&mdash;"</p>
<p>"I'll tell you when you tell me. It's a money difficulty, I
suppose; isn't it?"</p>
<p>"Yes."</p>
<p>"Cards?"</p>
<p>"P-partly."</p>
<p>"Oh, a note? Case of honour? Where is this I.O.U. that you
gave?"</p>
<p>"It's worse than that. The&mdash;the note is paid. Good
God&mdash;I can't tell you&mdash;"</p>
<p>"You must. That's why I'm here, Gerald."</p>
<p>"Well, then, I&mdash;I drew a check&mdash;knowing that I had no
funds. If it&mdash;if they return it, marked&mdash;"</p>
<p>"I see. . . . What are the figures?"</p>
<p>The boy stammered them out; Selwyn's grave face grew graver
still.</p>
<p>"That is bad," he said slowly&mdash;"very bad. Have
you&mdash;but of course you couldn't have seen Austin&mdash;"</p>
<p>"I'd kill myself first!" said Gerald fiercely.</p>
<p>"No, you wouldn't do that. You're not <i>that</i> kind. . . .
Keep perfectly cool, Gerald; because it is going to be fixed. The
method only remains to be decided upon&mdash;"</p>
<p>"I can't take your money!" stammered the boy; "I can't take a
cent from you&mdash;after what I've said&mdash;the beastly things
I've said&mdash;"</p>
<p>"It isn't the things you say to me, Gerald, that matter. . . .
Let me think a bit&mdash;and don't worry. Just lie quietly, and
understand that I'll do the worrying. And while I'm amusing myself
with a little quiet reflection as to ways and means, just take your
own bearings from this reef; and set a true course once more,
Gerald. That is all the reproach, all the criticism you are going
to get from me. Deal with yourself and your God in silence."</p>
<p>And in silence and heavy dismay Selwyn confronted the sacrifice
he must make to save the honour of the house of Erroll.</p>
<p>It meant more than temporary inconvenience to himself; it meant
that he must go into the market and sell securities which were
partly his capital, and from which came the modest income that
enabled him to live as he did.</p>
<p>There was no other way, unless he went to Austin. But he dared
not do that&mdash;dared not think what Austin's action in the
matter might be. And he knew that if Gerald were ever driven into
hopeless exile with Austin's knowledge of his disgrace rankling,
the boy's utter ruin must result inevitably.</p>
<p>Yet&mdash;yet&mdash;how could he afford to do
this&mdash;unoccupied, earning nothing, bereft of his profession,
with only the chance in view that his Chaosite might turn out
stable enough to be marketable? How could he dare so strip himself?
Yet, there was no other way; it had to be done; and done at
once&mdash;the very first thing in the morning before it became too
late.</p>
<p>And at first, in the bitter resentment of the necessity, his
impulse was to turn on Gerald and bind him to good conduct by every
pledge the boy could give. At least there would be compensation.
Yet, with the thought came the clear conviction of its futility.
The boy had brushed too close to dishonour not to recognise it. And
if this were not a lifelong lesson to him, no promises forced from
him in his dire need and distress, no oaths, no pledges could bind
him; no blame, no admonition, no scorn, no contempt, no reproach
could help him to see more clearly the pit of destruction than he
could see now.</p>
<p>"You need sleep, Gerald," he said quietly. "Don't worry; I'll
see that your check is not dishonoured; all you have to see to is
yourself. Good-night, my boy."</p>
<p>But Gerald could not speak; and so Selwyn left him and walked
slowly back to his own room, where he seated himself at his desk,
grave, absent-eyed, his unfilled pipe between his teeth.</p>
<p>And he sat there until he had bitten clean through the amber
mouthpiece, so that the brier bowl fell clattering to the floor. By
that time it was full daylight; but Gerald was still asleep. He
slept late into the afternoon; but that evening, when Selwyn and
Lansing came in to persuade him to go with them to Silverside,
Gerald was gone.</p>
<p>They waited another day for him; he did not appear. And that
night they left for Silverside without him.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_VIII" id="CHAPTER_VIII"></a>CHAPTER VIII</h2>
<h3>SILVERSIDE</h3>
<p>During that week-end at Silverside Boots behaved like a
school-lad run wild. With Drina's hand in his, half a dozen dogs as
advanced guard, and heavily flanked by the Gerard battalion, he
scoured the moorlands from Surf Point to the Hither Woods; from
Wonder Head to Sky Pond.</p>
<p>Ever hopeful of rabbit and fox, Billy urged on his cheerful
waddling pack and the sea wind rang with the crack of his whip and
the treble note of his whistle. Drina, lately inoculated with the
virus of nature-study, carried a green gauze butterfly net, while
Boots's pockets bulged with various lethal bottles and perforated
tin boxes for the reception of caterpillars. The other children,
like the puppies of Billy's pack, ran haphazard, tireless and eager
little opportunists, eternal prisoners of hope, tripped flat by
creepers, scratched and soiled in thicket and bog, but always up
and forward again, ranging out, nose in the wind, dauntless,
expectant, wonder-eyed.</p>
<p>Nina, Eileen, and Selwyn formed a lagging and leisurely
rear-guard, though always within signalling distance of Boots and
the main body; and, when necessary, the two ex-army men wig-wagged
to each other across the uplands to the endless excitement and
gratification of the children.</p>
<p>It was a perfect week-end; the sky, pale as a robin's egg at
morn and even, deepened to royal blue under the noon-day sun; and
all the world&mdash;Long Island&mdash;seemed but a gigantic
gold-green boat stemming the running purple of the sea and
Sound.</p>
<p>The air, when still, quivered in that deep, rich silence
instinct with the perpetual monotone of the sea; stiller for the
accentless call of some lone moorland bird, or the gauzy clatter of
a dragon-fly in reedy reaches. But when the moon rose and the
breeze awakened, and the sedges stirred, and the cat's-paws raced
across the moonlit ponds, and the far surf off Wonder Head intoned
the hymn of the four winds, the trinity, earth and sky and water,
became one thunderous symphony&mdash;a harmony of sound and colour
silvered to a monochrome by the moon.</p>
<p>Then, through the tinted mystery the wild ducks, low flying,
drove like a flight of witches through the dusk; and unseen herons
called from their heronry, fainter, fainter till their goblin yelps
died out in the swelling murmur of a million wind-whipped
leaves.</p>
<p>Then was the moorland waste bewitching in its alternation of
softly checkered gray and shade, where acres of feathery grasses
flowed in wind-blown furrows; where in the purple obscurity of
hollows the strange and aged little forests grew restless and full
of echoes; where shadowy reeds like elfin swords clattered and
thrust and parried across the darkling pools of haunted waters
unstirred save for the swirl of a startled fish or the smoothly
spreading wake of some furry creature swimming without a sound.</p>
<p>Into this magic borderland, dimmer for moonlit glimpses in
ghostly contrast to the shadow shape of wood and glade, Eileen
conducted Selwyn; and they heard the whirr of painted wood-ducks
passing in obscurity, and the hymn of the four winds off Wonder
Head; and they heard the herons, noisy in their heronry, and a
young fox yapping on a moon-struck dune.</p>
<p>But Selwyn cared more for the sun and the infinite blue above,
and the vast cloud-forms piled up in argent splendour behind a sea
of amethyst.</p>
<p>"The darker, vaguer phases of beauty," he said to Eileen,
smiling, "attract and fascinate those young in experience. Tragedy
is always better appreciated and better rendered by those who have
never lived it. The anatomy of sadness, the subtler fascination of
life brooding in shadow, appeals most keenly to those who can study
and reflect, then dismiss it all and return again to the brightness
of existence which has not yet for them been tarnished."</p>
<p>He had never before, even by slightest implication, referred to
his own experience with life. She was not perfectly certain that he
did so now.</p>
<p>They were standing on one of the treeless hills&mdash;a riotous
tangle of grasses and wild flowers&mdash;looking out to sea across
Sky Pond. He had a rod; and as he stood he idly switched the gaily
coloured flies backward and forward.</p>
<p>"My tastes," he said, still smiling, "incline me to the garishly
sunlit side of this planet." And, to tease her and arouse her to
combat: "I prefer a farandole to a nocturne; I'd rather have a
painting than an etching; Mr. Whistler bores me with his
monochromatic mud; I don't like dull colours, dull sounds, dull
intellects; and anything called 'an arrangement' on canvas, or
anything called 'a human document' or 'an appreciation' in
literature, or anything 'precious' in art, or any author who
'weaves' instead of writes his stories&mdash;all these irritate me
when they do not first bore me to the verge of
an&aelig;sthesia."</p>
<p>He switched his trout-flies defiantly, hopeful of an indignant
retort from her; but she only laughed and glanced at him, and shook
her pretty head.</p>
<p>"There's just enough truth in what you say to make a dispute
quite profitless. Besides, I don't feel like single combat; I'm too
glad to have you here."</p>
<p>Standing there&mdash;fairly swimming&mdash;in the delicious
upper-air currents, she looked blissfully across the rolling moors,
while the sunlight drenched her and the salt wind winnowed the
ruddy glory of her hair, and from the tangle of tender blossoming
green things a perfume mounted, saturating her senses as she
breathed it deeper in the happiness of desire fulfilled and content
quite absolute.</p>
<p>"After all," she said, "what more is there than this? Earth and
sea and sky and sun, and a friend to show them to. . . . Because,
as I wrote you, the friend is quite necessary in the scheme of
things&mdash;to round out the symmetry of it all. . . . I suppose
you're dying to dangle those flies in Brier Water to see whether
there are any trout there. Well, there are; Austin stocked it years
ago, and he never fishes, so no doubt it's full of fish. . . . What
is that black thing moving along the edge of the Golden Marsh?"</p>
<p>"A mink," he said, looking.</p>
<p>She seated herself cross-legged on the hill-top to watch the
mink at her leisure. But the lithe furry creature took to the
water, dived, and vanished, and she turned her attention to the
landscape.</p>
<p>"Do you see that lighthouse far to the south?" she asked; "that
is Frigate Light. West of it lies Surf Point, and the bay between
is Surf Bay. That's where I nearly froze solid in my first ocean
bath of the year. A little later we can bathe in that cove to the
north&mdash;the Bay of Shoals. You see it, don't you?&mdash;there,
lying tucked in between Wonder Head and the Hither Woods; but I
forgot! Of course you've been here before; and you know all this;
don't you?"</p>
<p>"Yes," he said quietly, "my brother and I came here as
boys."</p>
<p>"Have you not been here since?"</p>
<p>"Once." He turned and looked down at the sea-battered wharf
jutting into the Bay of Shoals. "Once, since I was a boy," he
repeated; "but I came alone. The transports landed at that wharf
after the Spanish war. The hospital camp was yonder. . . . My
brother died there."</p>
<p>She lifted her clear eyes to his; he was staring at the outline
of the Hither Woods fringing the ochre-tinted heights.</p>
<p>"There was no companion like him," he said; "there is no one to
take his place. Still, time helps&mdash;in a measure."</p>
<p>But he looked out across the sea with a grief for ever new.</p>
<p>She, too, had been helped by time; she was very young when the
distant and fabled seas took father and mother; and it was not
entirely their memory, but more the wistful lack of ability to
remember that left her so hopelessly alone.</p>
<p>Sharper his sorrow; but there was the comfort of recollection in
it; and she looked at him and, for an instant, envied him his
keener grief. Then leaning a little toward him where he reclined,
the weight of his body propped up on one arm, she laid her hand
across his hand half buried in the grass.</p>
<p>"It's only another tie between us," she said&mdash;"the memory
of your dead and mine. . . . Will you tell me about him?"</p>
<p>And leaning there, eyes on the sea, and her smooth, young hand
covering his, he told her of the youth who had died there in the
first flush of manhood and achievement.</p>
<p>His voice, steady and grave, came to her through hushed
intervals when the noise of the surf died out as the wind veered
seaward. And she listened, heart intent, until he spoke no more;
and the sea-wind rose again filling her ears with the ceaseless
menace of the surf.</p>
<p>After a while he picked up his rod, and sat erect and
cross-legged as she sat, and flicked the flies, absently, across
the grass, aiming at wind-blown butterflies.</p>
<p>"All these changes!" he exclaimed with a sweep of the rod-butt
toward Widgeon Bay. "When I was here as a boy there were no fine
estates, no great houses, no country clubs, no game
preserves&mdash;only a few fishermen's hovels along the Bay of
Shoals, and Frigate Light yonder. . . . Then Austin built
Silverside out of a much simpler, grand-paternal bungalow; then
came Sanxon Orchil and erected Hitherwood House on the foundations
of his maternal great-grandfather's cabin; and then the others
came; the Minsters built gorgeous Brookminster&mdash;you can just
make out their big summer palace&mdash;that white spot beyond Surf
Point!&mdash;and then the Lawns came and built Southlawn; and,
beyond, the Siowitha people arrived on scout, land-hungry and rich;
and the tiny hamlet of Wyossett grew rapidly into the town it now
is. Truly this island with its hundred miles of length has become
but a formal garden of the wealthy. Alas! I knew it as a stretch of
woods, dunes, and old-time villages where life had slumbered for
two hundred years!"</p>
<p>He fell silent, but she nodded him to go on.</p>
<p>"Brooklyn was a quiet tree-shaded town," he continued
thoughtfully, "unvexed by dreams of traffic; Flatbush an old Dutch
village buried in the scented bloom of lilac, locust, and syringa,
asleep under its ancient gables, hip-roofs, and spreading trees.
Bath, Utrecht, Canarsie, Gravesend were little more than cross-road
taverns dreaming in the sun; and that vile and noise-cursed island
beyond the Narrows was a stretch of unpolluted beauty in an
untainted sea&mdash;nothing but whitest sand and dunes and fragrant
bayberry and a blaze of wild flowers. Why"&mdash;and he turned
impatiently to the girl beside him&mdash;"why, I have seen the wild
geese settle in Sheepshead Bay, and the wild duck circling over it;
and I am not very aged. Think of it! Think of what this was but a
few years ago, and think of what 'progress' has done to lay it
waste! What will it be to-morrow?"</p>
<p>"Oh&mdash;oh!" she protested, laughing; "I did not suppose you
were that kind of a Jeremiah!"</p>
<p>"Well, I am. I see no progress in prostrate forests, in
soft-coal smoke, in noise! I see nothing gained in trimming and
cutting and ploughing and macadamising a heavenly wilderness into
mincing little gardens for the rich." He was smiling at his own
vehemence, but she knew that he was more than half serious.</p>
<p>She liked him so; she always denied and disputed when he became
declamatory, though usually, in her heart, she agreed with him.</p>
<p>"Oh&mdash;oh!" she protested, shaking her head; "your philosophy
is that of all reactionaries&mdash;emotional arguments which never
can be justified. Why, if the labouring man delights in the
harmless hurdy-gurdy and finds his pleasure mounted on a wooden
horse, should you say that the island of his delight is 'vile'? All
fulfilment of harmless happiness is progress, my poor
friend&mdash;"</p>
<p>"But my harmless happiness lay in seeing the wild-fowl splashing
where nothing splashes now except beer and the bathing rabble. If
progress is happiness&mdash;where is mine? Gone with the curlew and
the wild duck! Therefore, there is no progress. <i>Quod erat</i>,
my illogical friend."</p>
<p>"But <i>your</i> happiness in such things was an
exception&mdash;"</p>
<p>"Exceptions prove anything!"</p>
<p>"Yes&mdash;but&mdash;no, they don't, either! What nonsense you
can talk when you try to. . . . As for me I'm going down to the
Brier Water to look into it. If there are any trout there foolish
enough to bite at those gaudy-feathered hooks I'll call
you&mdash;"</p>
<p>"I'm going with you," he said, rising to his feet. She smilingly
ignored his offered hands and sprang erect unaided.</p>
<p>The Brier Water, a cold, deep, leisurely stream, deserved its
name. Rising from a small spring-pond almost at the foot of
Silverside lawn, it wound away through tangles of bull-brier and
wild-rose, under arches of weed and grass and clustered thickets of
mint, north through one of the strange little forests where it
became a thread edged with a duck-haunted bog, then emerging as a
clear deep stream once more it curved sharply south, recurved north
again, and flowed into Shell Pond which, in turn, had an outlet
into the Sound a mile east of Wonder Head.</p>
<p>If anybody ever haunted it with hostile designs upon its fishy
denizens, Austin at least never did. Belted kingfisher, heron,
mink, and perhaps a furtive small boy with pole and sinker and
barnyard worm&mdash;these were the only foes the trout might dread.
As for a man and a fly-rod, they knew him not, nor was there much
chance for casting a line, because the water everywhere flowed
under weeds, arched thickets of brier and grass, and leafy branches
criss-crossed above.</p>
<p>"This place is impossible," said Selwyn scornfully. "What is
Austin about to let it all grow up and run wild&mdash;"</p>
<p>"You <i>said</i>," observed Eileen, "that you preferred an
untrimmed wilderness; didn't you?"</p>
<p>He laughed and reeled in his line until only six inches of the
gossamer leader remained free. From this dangled a single
silver-bodied fly, glittering in the wind.</p>
<p>"There's a likely pool hidden under those briers," he said; "I'm
going to poke the tip of my rod under&mdash;this way&mdash;Hah!" as
a heavy splash sounded from depths unseen and the reel screamed as
he struck.</p>
<p>Up and down, under banks and over shallows rushed the invisible
fish; and Selwyn could do nothing for a while but let him go when
he insisted, and check and recover when the fish permitted.</p>
<p>Eileen, a spray of green mint between her vivid lips, watched
the performance with growing interest; but when at length a big,
fat, struggling speckled trout was cautiously but successfully
lifted out into the grass, she turned her back until the gallant
fighter had departed this life under a merciful whack from a
stick.</p>
<p>"That," she said faintly, "is the part I don't care for. . . .
Is he out of all pain? . . . What? Didn't feel any? Oh, are you
quite sure?"</p>
<div class="figcenter"><a href=
"images/facing_page288.jpg"><img src="images/facing_page288.jpg"
width="45%" alt="" title="" /></a><br />
<b>"Eileen watched the performance with growing
interest."</b>
<br /></div>
<p>She walked over to him and looked down at the beautiful victim
of craft.</p>
<p>"Oh, well," she sighed, "you are very clever, of course, and I
suppose I'll eat him; but I wish he were alive again, down there in
those cool, sweet depths."</p>
<p>"Killing frogs and insects and his smaller brother fish?"</p>
<p>"Did he do <i>that</i>?"</p>
<p>"No doubt of it. And if I hadn't landed him, a heron or a mink
would have done it sooner or later. That's what a trout is for: to
kill and be killed."</p>
<p>She smiled, then sighed. The taking of life and the giving of it
were mysteries to her. She had never wittingly killed anything.</p>
<p>"Do you say that it doesn't hurt the trout?" she asked.</p>
<p>"There are no nerves in the jaw muscles of a trout&mdash;Hah!"
as his rod twitched and swerved under water and his reel sang
again.</p>
<p>And again she watched the performance, and once more turned her
back.</p>
<p>"Let me try," she said, when the <i>coup-de-gr&acirc;ce</i> had
been administered to a lusty, brilliant-tinted bulltrout. And, rod
in hand, she bent breathless and intent over the bushes, cautiously
thrusting the tip through a thicket of mint.</p>
<p>She lost two fish, then hooked a third&mdash;a small one; but
when she lifted it gasping into the sunlight, she shivered and
called to Selwyn:</p>
<p>"Unhook it and throw it back! I&mdash;I simply can't stand
that!"</p>
<p>Splash! went the astonished trout; and she sighed her
relief.</p>
<p>"There's no doubt about it," she said, "you and I certainly do
belong to different species of the same genus; men and women
<i>are</i> separate species. Do you deny it?"</p>
<p>"I should hate to lose you that way," he returned teasingly.</p>
<p>"Well, you can't avoid it. I gladly admit that woman is not too
closely related to man. We don't like to kill things; it's an
ingrained distaste, not merely a matter of ethical philosophy. You
like to kill; and it's a trait common also to children and other
predatory animals. Which fact," she added airily, "convinces me of
woman's higher civilisation."</p>
<p>"It would convince me, too," he said, "if woman didn't eat the
things that man kills for her."</p>
<p>"I know; isn't it horrid! Oh, dear, we're neither of us very
high in the scale yet&mdash;particularly you."</p>
<p>"Well, I've advanced some since the good old days when a man
went wooing with a club," he suggested.</p>
<p>"<i>You</i> may have. But, anyway, you don't go wooing. As for
man collectively, he has not progressed so very far," she added
demurely. "As an example, that dreadful Draymore man actually hurt
my wrist."</p>
<p>Selwyn looked up quickly, a shade of frank annoyance on his face
and a vision of the fat sybarite before his eyes. He turned again
to his fishing, but his shrug was more of a shudder than appeared
to be complimentary to Percy Draymore.</p>
<p>She had divined, somehow, that it annoyed Selwyn to know that
men had importuned her. She had told him of her experience as
innocently as she had told Nina, and with even less embarrassment.
But that had been long ago; and now, without any specific reason,
she was not certain that she had acted wisely, although it always
amused her to see Selwyn's undisguised impatience whenever mention
was made of such incidents.</p>
<p>So, to torment him, she said: "Of course it is somewhat exciting
to be asked to marry people&mdash;rather agreeable than
otherwise&mdash;"</p>
<p>"What!"</p>
<p>Waist deep in bay-bushes he turned toward her where she sat on
the trunk of an oak which had fallen across the stream. Her arms
balanced her body; her ankles were interlocked. She swung her slim
russet-shod feet above the brook and looked at him with a touch of
<i>gaminerie</i> new to her and to him.</p>
<p>"Of course it's amusing to be told you are the only woman in the
world," she said, "particularly when a girl has a secret fear that
men don't consider her quite grown up."</p>
<p>"You once said," he began impatiently, "that the idiotic
importunities of those men annoyed you."</p>
<p>"Why do you call them idiotic?"&mdash;with pretence of hurt
surprise. "A girl is honoured&mdash;"</p>
<p>"Oh, bosh!"</p>
<p>"Captain Selwyn!"</p>
<p>"I beg your pardon," he said sulkily; and fumbled with his
reel.</p>
<p>She surveyed him, head a trifle on one side&mdash;the very
incarnation of youthful malice in process of satisfying a desire
for tormenting. Never before had she experienced that desire so
keenly, so unreasoningly; never before had she found such a curious
pleasure in punishing without cause. A perfectly inexplicable
exhilaration possessed her&mdash;a gaiety quite reasonless, until
every pulse in her seemed singing with laughter and quickening with
the desire for his torment.</p>
<p>"When I pretended I was annoyed by what men said to me, I was
only a yearling," she observed. "Now I'm a two-year, Captain
Selwyn. . . . Who can tell what may happen in my second
season?"</p>
<p>"You said that you were <i>not</i> the&mdash;the marrying sort,"
he insisted.</p>
<p>"Nonsense. All girls are. Once I sat in a high chair and wore a
bib and banqueted on cambric-tea and prunes. I don't do it now;
I've advanced. It's probably part of that progress which you are so
opposed to."</p>
<p>He did not answer, but stood, head bent, looping on a new
leader.</p>
<p>"All progress is admirable," she suggested.</p>
<p>No answer.</p>
<p>So, to goad him:</p>
<p>"There <i>are</i> men," she said dreamily, "who might hope for a
kinder reception next winter&mdash;"</p>
<p>"Oh, no," he said coolly, "there are no such gentlemen. If there
were you wouldn't say so."</p>
<p>"Yes, I would. And there are!"</p>
<p>"How many?" jeeringly, and now quite reassured.</p>
<p>"One!"</p>
<p>"You can't frighten me"&mdash;with a shade less confidence. "You
wouldn't tell if there was."</p>
<p>"I'd tell <i>you</i>."</p>
<p>"Me?"&mdash;with a sudden slump in his remaining stock of
reassurance.</p>
<p>"Certainly. I tell you and Nina things of that sort. And when I
have fully decided to marry I shall, of course, tell you both
before I inform other people."</p>
<p>How the blood in her young veins was racing and singing with
laughter! How thoroughly she was enjoying something to which she
could give neither reason nor name! But how satisfying it all
was&mdash;whatever it was that amused her in this man's
uncertainty, and in the faint traces of an irritation as
unreasoning as the source of it!</p>
<p>"Really, Captain Selwyn," she said, "you are not one of those
old-fashioned literary landmarks who objects through several
chapters to a girl's marrying&mdash;are you?"</p>
<p>"Yes," he said, "I am."</p>
<p>"You are quite serious?"</p>
<p>"Quite."</p>
<p>"You won't <i>let</i> me?"</p>
<p>"No, I won't."</p>
<p>"Why?"</p>
<p>"I want you myself," he said, smiling at last.</p>
<p>"That is flattering but horridly selfish. In other words you
won't marry me and you won't let anybody else do it."</p>
<p>"That is the situation," he admitted, freeing his line and
trying to catch the crinkled silvery snell of the new leader. It
persistently avoided him; he lowered the rod toward Miss Erroll;
she gingerly imprisoned the feathered fly between pink-tipped thumb
and forefinger and looked questioningly at him.</p>
<p>"Am I to sit here holding this?" she inquired.</p>
<p>"Only a moment; I'll have to soak that leader. Is the water
visible under that log you're sitting on?"</p>
<p>She nodded.</p>
<p>So he made his way through the brush toward her, mounted the
log, and, seating himself beside her, legs dangling, thrust the rod
tip and leader straight down into the stream below.</p>
<p>Glancing around at her he caught her eyes, bright with
mischief.</p>
<p>"You're capable of anything to-day," he said. "Were you
considering the advisability of starting me overboard?" And he
nodded toward the water beneath their feet.</p>
<p>"But you say that you won't let me throw you overboard, Captain
Selwyn!"</p>
<p>"I mean it, too," he returned.</p>
<p>"And I'm not to marry that nice young man?"&mdash;mockingly
sweet. "No? What!&mdash;not anybody at all&mdash;ever and
ever?"</p>
<p>"Me," he suggested, "if you're as thoroughly demoralised as
that."</p>
<p>"Oh! Must a girl be pretty thoroughly demoralised to marry
you?"</p>
<p>"I don't suppose she'd do it if she wasn't," he admitted,
laughing.</p>
<p>She considered him, head on one side:</p>
<p>"You are ornamental, anyway," she concluded.</p>
<p>"Well, then," he said, lifting the leader from the water to
inspect it, "will you have me?"</p>
<p>"Oh, but is there nothing to recommend you except your fatal
beauty?"</p>
<p>"My moustache," he ventured; "it's considered very useful when
I'm mentally perplexed."</p>
<p>"It's clipped too close; I have told you again and again that I
don't care for it clipped like that. Your mind would be a perfect
blank if you couldn't get hold of it."</p>
<p>"And to become imbecile," he said, "I've only to shave it."</p>
<p>She threw back her head and her clear laughter thrilled the
silence. He laughed, too, and sat with elbows on his thighs,
dabbling the crinkled leader to and fro in the pool below.</p>
<p>"So you won't have me?" he said.</p>
<p>"You haven't asked me&mdash;have you?"</p>
<p>"Well, I do now."</p>
<p>She mused, the smile resting lightly on lips and eyes.</p>
<p>"<i>Wouldn't</i> such a thing astonish Nina!" she said.</p>
<p>He did not answer; a slight colour tinged the new sunburn on his
cheeks.</p>
<p>She laughed to herself, clasped her hands, crossed her slender
feet, and bent her eyes on the pool below.</p>
<p>"Marriage," she said, pursuing her thoughts aloud, "is curiously
unnecessary to happiness. Take our pleasure in each other, for
example. It has, from the beginning, been perfectly free from
silliness and sentiment."</p>
<p>"Naturally," he said. "I'm old enough to be safe."</p>
<p>"You are not!" she retorted. "What a ridiculous thing to
say!"</p>
<p>"Well, then," he said, "I'm dreadfully unsafe, but yet you've
managed to escape. Is that it?"</p>
<p>"Perhaps. You <i>are</i> attractive to women! I've heard that
often enough to be convinced. Why, even I can see what attracts
them"&mdash;she turned to look at him&mdash;"the way your head and
shoulders set&mdash;and&mdash;well, the&mdash;rest. . . . It's
rather superior of me to have escaped sentiment, don't you think
so?"</p>
<p>"Indeed I do. Few&mdash;few escape where many meet to worship at
my frisky feet, and this I say without conceit is due to my
mustachios. Tangled in those like web-tied flies, imprisoned hearts
complain in sighs&mdash;in fact, the situation vies with moments in
Boccaccio."</p>
<p>Her running comment was her laughter, ringing deliciously amid
the trees until a wild bird, restlessly attentive, ventured a long,
sweet response from the tangled green above them.</p>
<p>After their laughter the soberness of reaction left them silent
for a while. The wild bird sang and sang, dropping fearlessly
nearer from branch to branch, until in his melody she found the key
to her dreamy thoughts.</p>
<p>"Because," she said, "you are so unconscious of your own value,
I like you best, I think. I never before quite realised just what
it was in you."</p>
<p>"My value," he said, "is what you care to make it."</p>
<p>"Then nobody can afford to take you away from me, Captain
Selwyn."</p>
<p>He flushed with pleasure: "That is the prettiest thing a woman
ever admitted to a man," he said.</p>
<p>"You have said nicer things to me. That is your reward. I wonder
if you remember any of the nice things you say to me? Oh, don't
look so hurt and astonished&mdash;because I don't believe you do. .
. . Isn't it jolly to sit here and let life drift past us? Out
there in the world"&mdash;she nodded backward toward the
open&mdash;"out yonder all that 'progress' is whirling around the
world, and here we sit&mdash;just you and I&mdash;quite happily,
swinging our feet in perfect content and talking nonsense. . . .
What more is there after all than a companionship that admits both
sense and nonsense?"</p>
<p>She laughed, turning her chin on her shoulder to glance at him;
and when the laugh had died out she still sat lightly poised, chin
nestling in the hollow of her shoulder, considering him out of
friendly beautiful eyes in which no mockery remained.</p>
<p>"What more is there than our confidence in each other and our
content?" she said.</p>
<p>And, as he did not respond: "I wonder if you realise how
perfectly lovely you have been to me since you have come into my
life? Do you? Do you remember the first day&mdash;the very
first&mdash;how I sent word to you that I wished you to see my
first real dinner gown? Smile if you wish&mdash;Ah, but you don't,
you <i>don't</i> understand, my poor friend, how much you became to
me in that little interview. . . . Men's kindness is a strange
thing; they may try and try, and a girl may know they are trying
and, in her turn, try to be grateful. But it is all effort on both
sides. Then&mdash;with a word&mdash;an impulse born of chance or
instinct&mdash;a man may say and do that which a woman can never
forget&mdash;and would not if she could."</p>
<p>"Have I done&mdash;that?"</p>
<p>"Yes. Didn't you understand? Do you suppose any other man in the
world could have what you have had of me&mdash;of my real self? Do
you suppose for one instant that any other man than you could ever
obtain from me the confidence I offer you unasked? Do I not tell
you everything that enters my head and heart? Do you not know that
I care for you more than for anybody alive?"</p>
<p>"Gerald&mdash;"</p>
<p>She looked him straight in the eyes; her breath caught, but she
steadied her voice:</p>
<p>"I've got to be truthful," she said; "I care for you more than
for Gerald."</p>
<p>"And I for you more than anybody living," he said.</p>
<p>"Is it true?"</p>
<p>"It is the truth, Eileen."</p>
<p>"You&mdash;you make me very happy, Captain Selwyn."</p>
<p>"But&mdash;did you not know it before I told you?"</p>
<p>"I&mdash;y-yes; I hoped so." In the exultant reaction from the
delicious tension of avowal she laughed lightly, not knowing
why.</p>
<p>"The pleasure in it," she said, "is the certainty that I am
capable of making you happy. You have no idea how I desire to do
it. I've wanted to ever since I knew you&mdash;I've wanted to be
capable of doing it. And you tell me that I do; and I am utterly
and foolishly happy." The quick mischievous sparkle of
<i>gaminerie</i> flashed up, transforming her for an
instant&mdash;"Ah, yes; and I can make you unhappy, too, it seems,
by talking of marriage! That, too, is something&mdash;a delightful
power&mdash;but"&mdash;the malice dying to a spark in her brilliant
eyes&mdash;"I shall not torment you, Captain Selwyn. Will it make
you happier if I say, 'No; I shall never marry as long as I have
you'? Will it really? Then I say it; never, never will I marry as
long as I have your confidence and friendship. . . . But I want it
<i>all</i>!&mdash;every bit, please. And if ever there is another
woman&mdash;if ever you fall in love!&mdash;crack!&mdash;away I
go"&mdash;she snapped her white fingers&mdash;"like that!" she
added, "only quicker! Well, then! Be very, very careful, my friend!
. . . I wish there were some place here where I could curl up
indefinitely and listen to your views on life. You brought a book
to read, didn't you?"</p>
<p>He gave her a funny embarrassed glance: "Yes; I brought a sort
of a book."</p>
<p>"Then I'm all ready to be read to, thank you. . . . Please
steady me while I try to stand up on this log&mdash;one hand will
do&mdash;"</p>
<p>Scarcely in contact with him she crossed the log, sprang
blithely to the ground, and, lifting the hem of her summer gown an
inch or two, picked her way toward the bank above.</p>
<p>"We can see Nina when she signals us from the lawn to come to
luncheon," she said, gazing out across the upland toward the
silvery tinted hillside where Silverside stood, every pane
glittering with the white eastern sunlight.</p>
<p>In the dry, sweet grass she found a place for a nest, and
settled into it, head prone on a heap of scented bay leaves, elbows
skyward, and fingers linked across her chin. One foot was hidden,
the knee, doubled, making a tent of her white skirt, from an edge
of which a russet shoe projected, revealing the contour of a slim
ankle.</p>
<p>"What book did you bring?" she asked dreamily.</p>
<p>He turned red: "It's&mdash;it's just a chapter from a little
book I'm trying to write&mdash;a&mdash;a sort of suggestion for the
establishment of native regiments in the Philippines. I thought,
perhaps, you might not mind listening&mdash;"</p>
<p>Her delighted surprise and quick cordiality quite overwhelmed
him, so, sitting flat on the grass, hat off and the hill wind
furrowing his bright crisp hair, he began, na&iuml;vely, like a
schoolboy; and Eileen lay watching him, touched and amused at his
eager interest in reading aloud to her this mass of co-ordinated
fact and detail.</p>
<p>There was, in her, one quality to which he had never appealed in
vain&mdash;her loyalty. Confident of that, and of her intelligence,
he wasted no words in preliminary explanation, but began at once
his argument in favour of a native military establishment erected
on the general lines of the British organisation in India.</p>
<p>He wrote simply and without self-consciousness; loyalty aroused
her interest, intelligence sustained it; and when the end came, it
came too quickly for her, and she said so frankly, which delighted
him.</p>
<p>At her invitation he outlined for her the succeeding chapters
with terse military accuracy; and what she liked best and best
understood was avoidance of that false modesty which condescends,
turning technicality into pabulum.</p>
<p>Lying there in the fragrant verdure, blue eyes skyward or
slanting sideways to watch his face, she listened, answered,
questioned, or responded by turns; until their voices grew lazy and
the light reaction from things serious awakened the gaiety always
latent when they were together.</p>
<p>"Proceed," she smiled; "<i>Arma virumque</i>&mdash;a noble
theme, Captain Selwyn. Sing on!"</p>
<p>He shook his head, quoting from "The Dedication":</p>
<div class='blockquot'><span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">"Arms and
the Man!</span><br />
A noble theme I ween!<br />
Alas! I cannot sing of these, Eileen;<br />
Only of maids and men and meadow-grass,<br />
Of sea and tree and woodlands where I pass&mdash;<br />
Nothing but these I know, Eileen&mdash;alas!<br />
<br />
<hr style='width: 45%;' />
<br />
<br />
Clear eyes, that lifted up to me<br />
Free heart and soul of vanity;<br />
Blue eyes, that speak so wistfully&mdash;<br />
Nothing but these I know, alas!"</div>
<p>She laughed her acknowledgment, and lying there, face to the
sky, began to sing to herself, under her breath, fragments of that
ancient war-song:</p>
<div class='blockquot'>"Le bon Roi Dagobert<br />
Avait un grand sabre de fer;<br />
Le grand Saint &Eacute;loi<br />
Lui dit: 'O mon Roi<br />
V&ocirc;tre Majest&eacute;<br />
Pourrait se blesser!'<br />
'C'est vrai,' lui dit le Roi,<br />
'Qu'on me donne un sabre de bois!'"</div>
<p>"In that verse," observed Selwyn, smiling, "lies the true key to
the millennium&mdash;international disarmament and moral
suasion."</p>
<p>"Nonsense," she said lazily; "the millennium will arrive when
the false balance between man and woman is properly
adjusted&mdash;not before. And that means universal education. . .
. Did you ever hear that old, old song, written two centuries
ago&mdash;the 'Education of Phyllis'? No? Listen then and be
ashamed."</p>
<p>And lying there, the back of one hand above her eyes, she sang
in a sweet, childish, mocking voice, tremulous with hidden
laughter, the song of Phyllis the shepherdess and Sylvandre the
shepherd&mdash;how Phyllis, more avaricious than sentimental, made
Sylvandre pay her thirty sheep for one kiss; how, next day, the
price shifted to one sheep for thirty kisses; and then the dreadful
demoralisation of Phyllis:</p>
<div class='blockquot'>"Le lendemain, Philis, plus tendre<br />
Fut trop heureuse de lui rendre<br />
Trente moutons pour un baiser!<br />
<br />
<hr style='width: 45%;' />
<br />
<br />
Le lendemain, Philis, peu sage,<br />
Aurait donn&eacute; moutons et chien<br />
Pour un baiser que le volage<br />
&Agrave; Lisette donnait pour rien!"</div>
<p>"And there we are," said Eileen, sitting up abruptly and
levelling the pink-tipped finger of accusation at
him&mdash;"<i>there</i>, if you please, lies the woe of the
world&mdash;not in the armaments of nations! That old French poet
understood in half a second more than your Hague tribunal could
comprehend in its first Cathayan cycle! There lies the hope of your
millennium&mdash;in the higher education of the modern
Phyllis."</p>
<p>"And the up-to-date Sylvandre," added Selwyn.</p>
<p>"He knows too much already," she retorted, delicate nose in the
air. . . . "Hark! Ear to the ground! My atavistic and wilder
instincts warn me that somebody is coming!"</p>
<p>"Boots and Drina," said Selwyn; and he hailed them as they came
into view above. Then he sprang to his feet, calling out: "And
Gerald, too! Hello, old fellow! This is perfectly fine! When did
you arrive?"</p>
<p>"Oh, Gerald!" cried Eileen, both hands outstretched&mdash;"it's
splendid of you to come! Dear fellow! have you seen Nina and
Austin? And were they not delighted? And you've come to stay,
haven't you? There, I won't begin to urge you. . . . Look,
Gerald&mdash;look, Boots&mdash;and Drina, too&mdash;only look at
those beautiful big plump trout in Captain Selwyn's creel!"</p>
<p>"Oh, I say!" exclaimed Gerald, "you didn't take those in that
little brook&mdash;did you, Philip? Well, wouldn't that snare you!
I'm coming down here after luncheon; I sure am."</p>
<p>"You will, too, won't you?" asked Drina, jealous lest Boots, her
idol, miss his due share of piscatorial glory. "If you'll wait
until I finish my French I'll come with you."</p>
<p>"Of course I will," said Lansing reproachfully; "you don't
suppose there's any fun anywhere for me without you, do you?"</p>
<p>"No," said Drina simply, "I don't."</p>
<p>"Another Phyllis in embryo," murmured Eileen to Selwyn. "Alas!
for education!"</p>
<p>Selwyn laughed and turned to Gerald. "I hunted high and low for
you before I came to Silverside. You found my note?"</p>
<p>"Yes; I&mdash;I'll explain later," said the boy, colouring.
"Come ahead, Eily; Boots and I will take you on at tennis&mdash;and
Philip, too. We've an hour or so before luncheon. Is it a go?"</p>
<p>"Certainly," replied his sister, unaware of Selwyn's
proficiency, but loyal even in doubt. And the five, walking
abreast, moved off across the uplands toward the green lawns of
Silverside, where, under a gay lawn parasol, Nina sat, a "Nature
book" in hand, the centre of an attentive gathering composed of
dogs, children, and the cat, Kit-Ki, blinking her topaz-tinted eyes
in the sunshine.</p>
<p>The young mother looked up happily as the quintet came strolling
across the lawn: "Please don't wander away again before luncheon,"
she said; "Gerald, I suppose you are starved, but you've only an
hour to wait&mdash;Oh, Phil! what wonderful trout! Children, kindly
arise and admire the surpassing skill of your frivolous uncle!"
And, as the children and dogs came crowding around the opened
fish-basket she said to her brother in a low, contented voice:
"Gerald has quite made it up with Austin, dear; I think we have to
thank you, haven't we?"</p>
<p>"Has he really squared matters with Austin? That's
good&mdash;that's fine! Oh, no, I had nothing to do with
it&mdash;practically nothing. The boy is sound at the
core&mdash;that's what did it." And to Gerald, who was hailing him
from the veranda, "Yes, I've plenty of tennis-shoes. Help yourself,
old chap."</p>
<p>Eileen had gone to her room to don a shorter skirt and
rubber-soled shoes; Lansing followed her example; and Selwyn,
entering his own room, found Gerald trying on a pair of white
foot-gear.</p>
<p>The boy looked up, smiled, and, crossing one knee, began to tie
the laces:</p>
<p>"I told Austin that I meant to slow down," he said. "We're on
terms again. He was fairly decent."</p>
<p>"Good business!" commented Selwyn vigorously.</p>
<p>"And I'm cutting out cards and cocktails," continued the boy,
eager as a little lad who tells how good he has been all
day&mdash;"I made it plain to the fellows that there was nothing in
it for me. And, Philip, I'm boning down like thunder at the
office&mdash;I'm horribly in debt and I'm hustling to pay up and
make a clean start. You," he added, colouring, "will come
first&mdash;"</p>
<p>"At your convenience," said Selwyn, smiling.</p>
<p>"Not at all! Yours is the first account to be squared; then
Neergard&mdash;"</p>
<p>"Do you owe <i>him</i>, Gerald?"</p>
<p>"Do I? Oh, Lord! But he's a patient soul&mdash;really, Philip, I
wish you didn't dislike him so thoroughly, because he's good
company and besides that he's a very able man. . . . Well, we won't
talk about him, then. Come on; I'll lick the very life out of you
over the net!"</p>
<p>A few moments later the white balls were flying over the white
net, and active white-flannelled figures were moving swiftly over
the velvet turf.</p>
<p>Drina, aloft on the umpire's perch, calmly scored and decided
each point impartially, though her little heart was beating fast in
desire for her idol's supremacy; and it was all her official
composure could endure to see how Eileen at the net beat down his
defence, driving him with her volleys to the service line.</p>
<p>Selwyn's game proved to be steady, old-fashioned, but logical;
Eileen, sleeves at her elbows, red-gold hair in splendid disorder,
carried the game through Boots straight at her brother&mdash;and
the contest was really a brilliant duel between them, Lansing and
Selwyn assisting when a rare chance came their way. The pace was
too fast for them, however; they were in a different class and they
knew it; and after two terrific sets had gone against Gerald and
Boots, the latter, signalling Selwyn, dropped out and climbed up
beside Drina to watch a furious single between Eileen and
Gerald.</p>
<p>"Oh, Boots, Boots!" said Drina, "why <i>didn't</i> you stay
forward and kill her drives and make her lob? I just know you could
do it if you had only thought to play forward! What on earth was
the matter?"</p>
<p>"Age," said Mr. Lansing serenely&mdash;"decrepitude, Drina. I am
a Was, sweetheart, but Eileen still remains an Is."</p>
<p>"I won't let you say it! You are <i>not</i> a Was!" said the
child fiercely. "After luncheon you can take me on for practice.
Then you can just give it to her!"</p>
<p>"It would gratify me to hand a few swift ones to somebody," he
said. "Look at that demon girl, yonder! She's hammering Gerald to
the service line! Oh, my, oh, me! I'm only fit for hat-ball with
Billy or cat's-cradle with Kit-Ki. Drina, do you realise that I am
nearly thirty?"</p>
<p>"Pooh! I'm past thirteen. In five years I'll be eighteen. I
expect to marry you at eighteen. You promised."</p>
<p>"Sure thing," admitted Boots; "I've bought the house, you
know."</p>
<p>"I know it," said the child gravely.</p>
<p>Boots looked down at her; she smiled and laid her head, with its
clustering curls, against his shoulder, watching the game below
with the quiet composure of possession.</p>
<p>Their relations, hers and Lansing's, afforded infinite amusement
to the Gerards. It had been a desperate case from the very first;
and the child took it so seriously, and considered her claim on
Boots so absolute, that neither that young man nor anybody else
dared make a jest of the affair within her hearing.</p>
<p>From a dimple-kneed, despotic, strenuous youngster, ruling the
nursery with a small hand of iron, in half a year Drina had grown
into a rather slim, long-legged, coolly active child; and though
her hair had not been put up, her skirts had been lowered, and
shoes and stockings substituted for half-hose and sandals.</p>
<p>Weighted with this new dignity she had put away dolls,
officially. Unofficially she still dressed, caressed, forgave, or
spanked Rosalinda and Beatrice&mdash;but she excluded the younger
children from the nursery when she did it.</p>
<p>However, the inborn necessity for mimicry and romance remained;
and she satisfied it by writing stories&mdash;marvellous
ones&mdash;which she read to Boots. Otherwise she was the same
active, sociable, wholesome, intelligent child, charmingly casual
and inconsistent; and the list of her youthful admirers at
dancing-school and parties required the alphabetical classification
of Mr. Lansing.</p>
<p>But Boots was her own particular possession; he was her chattel,
her thing; and he and other people knew that it was no light affair
to meddle with the personal property of Drina Gerard.</p>
<p>Her curly head resting against his arm, she was now planning his
future movements for the day:</p>
<p>"You may do what you please while I'm having French," she said
graciously; "after that we will go fishing in Brier Water; then
I'll come home to practice, while you sit on the veranda and
listen; then I'll take you on at tennis, and by that time the
horses will be brought around and we'll ride to the Falcon. You
won't forget any of this, will you? Come on; Eileen and Gerald have
finished and there's Dawson to announce luncheon!" And to Gerald,
as she climbed down to the ground: "Oh, what a muff! to let Eileen
beat you six&mdash;five, six&mdash;three! . . . Where's my hat? . .
. Oh, the dogs have got it and are tearing it to rags!"</p>
<p>And she dashed in among the dogs, slapping right and left, while
a facetious dachshund seized the tattered bit of lace and muslin
and fled at top speed.</p>
<p>"That is pleasant," observed Nina; "it's her best hat,
too&mdash;worn to-day in your honour, Boots. . . . Children! Hands
and faces! There is Bridget waiting! Come, Phil; there's no law
against talking at table, and there's no use trying to run an
establishment if you make a mockery of the kitchen."</p>
<p>Eileen, one bare arm around her brother's shoulders, strolled
houseward across the lawn, switching the shaven sod with her
tennis-bat.</p>
<p>"What are you doing this afternoon?" she said to Selwyn.
"Gerald"&mdash;she touched her brother's smooth cheek&mdash;"means
to fish; Boots and Drina are keen on it, too; and Nina is driving
to Wyossett with the children."</p>
<p>"And you?" he asked, smiling.</p>
<p>"Whatever you wish"&mdash;confident that he wanted her, whatever
he had on hand.</p>
<p>"I ought to walk over to Storm Head," he said, "and get things
straightened out."</p>
<p>"Your laboratory?" asked Gerald. "Austin told me when I saw him
in town that you were going to have the cottage on Storm Head to
make powder in."</p>
<p>"Only in minute quantities, Gerald," explained Selwyn; "I just
want to try a few things. . . . And if they turn out all right,
what do you say to taking a look in&mdash;if Austin approves?"</p>
<p>"Oh, please, Gerald," whispered his sister.</p>
<p>"Do you really believe there is anything in it?" asked the boy.
"Because, if you are sure&mdash;"</p>
<p>"There certainly is if I can prove that my powder is able to
resist heat, cold, and moisture. The Lawn people stand ready to
talk matters over as soon as I am satisfied. . . . There's plenty
of time&mdash;but keep the suggestion in the back of your head,
Gerald."</p>
<p>The boy smiled, nodded importantly, and went off to remove the
stains of tennis from his person; and Eileen went, too, turning
around to look back at Selwyn:</p>
<p>"Thank you for asking Gerald! I'm sure he will love to go into
anything you think safe."</p>
<p>"Will you join us, too?" he called back, smilingly&mdash;"we may
need capital!"</p>
<p>"I'll remember that!" she said; and, turning once more as she
reached the landing: "Good-bye&mdash;until luncheon!" And touched
her lips with the tips of her fingers, flinging him a gay
salute.</p>
<p>In parting and meeting&mdash;even after the briefest of
intervals&mdash;it was always the same with her; always she had for
him some informal hint of the formality of parting; always some
recognition of their meeting&mdash;in the light touching of hands
as though the symbol of ceremony, at least, was due to him, to
herself, and to the occasion.</p>
<p>Luncheon at Silverside was anything but a function&mdash;with
the children at table and the dogs in a semicircle, and the nurses
tying bibs and admonishing the restless or belligerent, and the
wide French windows open, and the sea wind lifting the curtains and
stirring the cluster of wild flowers in the centre of the
table.</p>
<p>Kit-Ki's voice was gently raised at intervals; at intervals some
grinning puppy, unable to longer endure the nourishing odours, lost
self-control and yapped, then lowered his head, momentarily
overcome with mortification.</p>
<p>All the children talked continuously, unlimited conversation
being permitted until it led to hostilities or puppy-play. The
elders conducted such social intercourse as was possible under the
conditions, but luncheon was the children's hour at Silverside.</p>
<p>Nina and Eileen talked garden talk&mdash;they both were quite
mad about their fruit-trees and flower-beds; Selwyn, Gerald, and
Boots discussed stables, golf links, and finally the new business
which Selwyn hoped to develop.</p>
<p>Afterward, when the children had been excused, and Drina had
pulled her chair close to Lansing's to listen&mdash;and after that,
on the veranda, when the men sat smoking and Drina was talking
French, and Nina and Eileen had gone off with baskets, trowels, and
pruning-shears&mdash;Selwyn still continued in conference with
Boots and Gerald; and it was plain that his concise, modest
explanation of what he had accomplished in his experiments with
Chaosite seriously impressed the other men.</p>
<p>Boots frankly admitted it: "Besides," he said, "if the Lawn
people are so anxious for you to give them first say in the matter
I don't see why we shouldn't have faith in it&mdash;enough, I mean,
to be good to ourselves by offering to be good to you, Phil."</p>
<p>"Wait until Austin comes down&mdash;and until I've tried one or
two new ideas," said Selwyn. "Nothing on earth would finish me
quicker than to get anybody who trusted me into a worthless
thing."</p>
<p>"It's plain," observed Boots, "that although you may have been
an army captain you're no captain of industry&mdash;you're not even
a non-com.!"</p>
<p>Selwyn laughed: "Do you really believe that ordinary decency is
uncommon?"</p>
<p>"Look at Long Island," returned Boots. "Where does the boom of
worthless acreage and paper cities land investors when it
explodes?"</p>
<p>Gerald had flushed up at the turn in the conversation; and
Selwyn steered Lansing into other and safer channels until Gerald
went away to find a rod.</p>
<p>And, as Drina had finished her French lesson, she and Lansing
presently departed, brandishing fishing-rods adorned with the
gaudiest of flies.</p>

<p>The house and garden at Silverside seemed to be logical parts of
a landscape, which included uplands, headlands, sky, and
water&mdash;a silvery harmonious ensemble, where the artificial
portion was neither officiously intrusive nor, on the other hand,
meagre and insignificant.</p>
<p>The house, a long two-storied affair with white shutters and
pillared veranda, was built of gray stone; the garden was walled
with it&mdash;a precaution against no rougher intruder than the
wind, which would have whipped unsheltered flowers and fruit-trees
into ribbons.</p>
<p>Walks of hardened earth, to which green mould clung in patches,
wound through the grounds and threaded the three little groves of
oak, chestnut, and locust, in the centres of which, set in circular
lawns, were the three axes of interest&mdash;the stone-edged
fish-pond, the spouting fountain, and the ancient ship's
figurehead&mdash;a wind-worn, sea-battered mermaid cuddling a tiny,
finny sea-child between breast and lips.</p>
<p>Whoever the unknown wood-carver had been he had been an artist,
too, and a good one; and when the big China trader, the <i>First
Born</i>, went to pieces off Frigate Light, fifty years ago, this
figurehead had been cast up from the sea.</p>
<p>Wandering into the garden, following the first path at random,
Selwyn chanced upon it, and stood, pipe in his mouth, hands in his
pockets, surprised and charmed.</p>
<p>Plunkitt, the head gardener, came along, trundling a
mowing-machine.</p>
<p>"Ain't it kind 'er nice," he said, lingering. "When I pass here
moonlight nights, it seems like that baby was a-smilin' right up
into his mamma's face, an' that there fish-tailed girl was laughin'
back at him. Come here some night when there's a moon, Cap'in
Selwyn."</p>
<p>Selwyn stood for a while listening to the musical click of the
machine, watching the green shower flying into the sunshine, and
enjoying the raw perfume of juicy, new-cut grass; then he wandered
on in quest of Miss Erroll.</p>
<p>Tulips, narcissus, hyacinths, and other bulbs were entirely out
of bloom, but the earlier herbaceous borders had come into flower,
and he passed through masses of pink and ivory-tinted
peonies&mdash;huge, heavy, double blossoms, fragrant and delicate
as roses. Patches of late iris still lifted crested heads above
pale sword-bladed leaves; sheets of golden pansies gilded spaces
steeped in warm transparent shade, but larkspur and early rocket
were as yet only scarcely budded promises; the phlox-beds but green
carpets; and zinnia, calendula, poppy, and coreopsis were
symphonies in shades of green against the dropping pink of
bleeding-hearts or the nascent azure of flax and spiderwort.</p>
<p>In the rose garden, and along that section of the wall included
in it, the rich, dry, porous soil glimmered like gold under the
sun; and here Selwyn discovered Nina and Eileen busily solicitous
over the tender shoots of favourite bushes. A few long-stemmed
early rosebuds lay in their baskets; Selwyn drew one through his
buttonhole and sat down on a wheelbarrow, amiably disposed to look
on and let the others work.</p>
<p>"Not much!" said Nina. "You can start in and 'pinch back' this
prairie climber&mdash;do you hear, Phil? I won't let you dawdle
around and yawn while I'm pricking my fingers every instant! Make
him move, Eileen."</p>
<p>Eileen came over to him, fingers doubled into her palm and small
thumb extended.</p>
<p>"Thorns and prickles, please," she said; and he took her hand in
his and proceeded to extract them while she looked down at her
almost invisible wounds, tenderly amused at his fear of hurting
her.</p>
<p>"Do you know," she said, "that people are beginning to open
their houses yonder?" She nodded toward the west: "The Minsters are
on the way to Brookminster, the Orchils have already arrived at
Hitherwood House, and the coachmen and horses were housed at
Southlawn last night. I rather dread the dinners and country
formality that always interfere with the jolly times we have; but
it will be rather good fun at the bathing-beach. . . . Do you swim
well? But of course you do."</p>
<p>"Pretty well; do you?"</p>
<p>"I'm a fish. Gladys Orchil and I would never leave the surf if
they didn't literally drag us home. . . . You know Gladys Orchil? .
. . She's very nice; so is Sheila Minster; you'll like her better
in the country than you do in town. Kathleen Lawn is nice, too.
Alas! I see many a morning where Drina and I twirl our respective
thumbs while you and Boots are off with a gayer set. . . . Oh,
don't interrupt! No mortal man is proof against Sheila and Gladys
and Kathleen&mdash;and you're not a demi-god&mdash;are you? . . .
Thank you for your surgery upon my thumb&mdash;" She na&iuml;vely
placed the tip of it between her lips and looked at him, standing
there like a schoolgirl in her fresh gown, burnished hair loosened
and curling in riotous beauty across cheeks and ears.</p>
<p>He had seated himself on the wheelbarrow again; she stood
looking down at him, hands now bracketed on her narrow
hips&mdash;so close that the fresh fragrance of her grew faintly
perceptible&mdash;a delicate atmosphere of youth mingling with the
perfume of the young garden.</p>
<p>Nina, basket on her arm, snipping away with her garden shears,
glanced over her shoulder&mdash;and went on, snipping. They did not
notice how far away her agricultural ardour led her&mdash;did not
notice when she stood a moment at the gate looking back at them, or
when she passed out, pretty head bent thoughtfully, the shears
swinging loose at her girdle.</p>
<p>The prairie rosebuds in Eileen's basket exhaled their wild,
sweet odour; and Selwyn, breathing it, removed his hat like one who
faces a cooling breeze, and looked up at the young girl standing
before him as though she were the source of all things sweet and
freshening in this opening of the youngest year of his life.</p>
<p>She said, smiling absently at his question: "Certainly one can
grow younger; and you have done it in a day, here with me."</p>
<p>She looked down at his hair; it was bright and inclined to wave
a little, but whether the lighter colour at the temples was really
silvered or only a paler tint she was not sure.</p>
<p>"You are very like a boy, sometimes," she said&mdash;"as young
as Gerald, I often think&mdash;especially when your hat is off. You
always look so perfectly groomed: I wonder&mdash;I wonder what you
would look like if your hair were rumpled?"</p>
<p>"Try it," he suggested lazily.</p>
<p>"I? I don't think I dare&mdash;" She raised her hand, hesitated,
the gay daring in her eyes deepening to audacity. "Shall I?"</p>
<p>"Why not?"</p>
<p>"T-touch your hair?&mdash;rumple it?&mdash;as I would Gerald's!
. . . I'm tempted to&mdash;only&mdash;only&mdash;"</p>
<p>"What?"</p>
<p>"I don't know; I couldn't. I&mdash;it was only the temptation of
a second&mdash;" She laughed uncertainly. The suggestion of the
intimacy tinted her cheeks with its reaction; she took a short step
backward; instinct, blindly stirring, sobered her; and as the smile
faded from eye and lip, his face changed, too. And far, very far
away in the silent cells of his heart a distant pulse awoke.</p>
<p>She turned to her roses again, moving at random among the
bushes, disciplining with middle-finger and thumb a translucent,
amber-tinted shoot here and there. And when the silence had lasted
too long, she broke it without turning toward him:</p>
<p>"After all, if it were left to me, I had rather be merciful to
these soft little buds and sprays, and let the sun and the showers
take charge. A whole cluster of blossoms left free to grow as Fate
fashions them!&mdash;Why not? It is certainly very officious of me
to strip a stem of its hopes just for the sake of one pampered
blossom. . . . Non-interference is a safe creed, isn't it?"</p>
<p>But she continued moving along among the bushes, pinching back
here, snipping, trimming, clipping there; and after a while she had
wandered quite beyond speaking distance; and, at leisurely
intervals she straightened up and turned to look back across the
roses at him&mdash;quiet, unsmiling gaze in exchange for his
unchanging eyes, which never left her.</p>
<p>She was at the farther edge of the rose garden now where a boy
knelt, weeding; and Selwyn saw her speak to him and give him her
basket and shears; and saw the boy start away toward the house,
leaving her leaning idly above the sun-dial, elbows on the
weather-beaten stone, studying the carved figures of the dial. And
every line and contour and curve of her figure&mdash;even the
lowered head, now resting between both hands&mdash;summoned
him.</p>
<p>She heard his step, but did not move; and when he leaned above
the dial, resting on his elbows, beside her, she laid her finger on
the shadow of the dial.</p>
<p>"Time," she said, "is trying to frighten me. It pretends to be
nearly five o'clock; do you believe it?"</p>
<p>"Time is running very fast with me," he said.</p>
<p>"With me, too; I don't wish it to; I don't care for third speed
forward all the time."</p>
<p>He was bending closer above the stone dial, striving to decipher
the inscription on it:</p>
<div class='blockquot'><span style="margin-left: 4em;">"Under blue
skies</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 4em;">My shadow lies.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 4em;">Under gray skies</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 4em;">My shadow dies.</span><br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">"If over me</span><br />
Two Lovers leaning<br />
Would solve my Mystery<br />
And read my Meaning,<br />
&mdash;Or clear, or overcast the Skies&mdash;<br />
The Answer always lies within their Eyes.<br />
Look long! Look long! For there, and there alone<br />
Time solves the Riddle graven on this Stone!"</div>
<p>Elbows almost touching they leaned at ease, idly reading the
almost obliterated lines engraved there.</p>
<p>"I never understood it," she observed, lightly scornful. "What
occult meaning has a sun-dial for the spooney? <i>I'm</i> sure I
don't want to read riddles in a strange gentleman's optics."</p>
<p>"The verses," he explained, "are evidently addressed to the
spooney, so why should you resent them?"</p>
<p>"I don't. . . . I can be spoons, too, for that matter; I mean I
could once."</p>
<p>"But you're past spooning now," he concluded.</p>
<p>"Am I? I rather resent your saying it&mdash;your calmly
excluding me from anything I might choose to do," she said. "If I
cared&mdash;if I chose&mdash;if I really wanted to&mdash;"</p>
<p>"You could still spoon? Impossible! At your age? Nonsense!"</p>
<p>"It isn't at all impossible. Wait until there's a moon, and a
canoe, and a nice boy who is young enough to be frightened
easily!"</p>
<p>"And I," he retorted, "am too old to be frightened; so there's
no moon, no canoe, no pretty girl, no spooning for me. Is that it,
Eileen?"</p>
<p>"Oh, Gladys and Sheila will attend to you, Captain Selwyn."</p>
<p>"Why Gladys Orchil? Why Sheila Minster? And why <i>not</i>
Eileen Erroll?"</p>
<p>"Spoon? With <i>you</i>!"</p>
<p>"You are quite right," he said, smiling; "it would be poor
sport."</p>
<p>There had been no change in his amused eyes, in his voice; yet,
sensitive to the imperceptible, the girl looked up quickly. He
laughed and straightened up; and presently his eyes grew absent and
his sun-burned hand sought his moustache.</p>
<p>"Have you misunderstood me?" she asked in a low voice.</p>
<p>"How, child?"</p>
<p>"I don't know. . . . Shall we walk a little?"</p>
<p>When they came to the stone fish-pond she seated herself for a
moment on a marble bench, then, curiously restless, rose again; and
again they moved forward at hazard, past the spouting fountain,
which was a driven well, out of which a crystal column of water
rose, geyser-like, dazzling in the westering sun rays.</p>
<p>"Nina tells me that this water rises in the Connecticut hills,"
he said, "and flows as a subterranean sheet under the Sound,
spouting up here on Long Island when you drive a well."</p>
<p>She looked at the column of flashing water, nodding silent
assent.</p>
<p>They moved on, the girl curiously reserved, non-communicative,
head slightly lowered; the man vague-eyed, thoughtful, pacing
slowly at her side. Behind them their long shadows trailed across
the brilliant grass.</p>
<p>Traversing the grove which encircled the newly clipped lawn, now
fragrant with sun-crisped grass-tips left in the wake of the mower,
he glanced up at the pretty mermaid mother cuddling her tiny
offspring against her throat. Across her face a bar of pink
sunlight fell, making its contour exquisite.</p>
<p>"Plunkitt tells me that they really laugh at each other in the
moonlight," he said.</p>
<p>She glanced up; then away from him:</p>
<p>"You seem to be enamoured of the moonlight," she said.</p>
<p>"I like to prowl in it."</p>
<p>"Alone?"</p>
<p>"Sometimes."</p>
<p>"And&mdash;at other times?"</p>
<p>He laughed: "Oh, I'm past that, as you reminded me a moment
ago."</p>
<p>"Then you <i>did</i> misunderstand me!"</p>
<p>"Why, no&mdash;"</p>
<p>"Yes, you did! But I supposed you knew."</p>
<p>"Knew what, Eileen?" "What I meant."</p>
<p>"You meant that I am <i>hors de concours</i>."</p>
<p>"I didn't!"</p>
<p>"But I am, child. I was, long ago."</p>
<p>She looked up: "Do you really think that, Captain Selwyn? If you
do&mdash;I am glad."</p>
<p>He laughed outright. "You are glad that I'm safely past the
spooning age?" he inquired, moving forward.</p>
<p>She halted: "Yes. Because I'm quite sure of you if you are; I
mean that I can always keep you for myself. Can't I?"</p>
<p>She was smiling and her eyes were clear and fearless, but there
was a wild-rose tint on her cheeks which deepened a little as he
turned short in his tracks, gazing straight at her.</p>
<p>"You wish to keep me&mdash;for yourself?" he repeated,
laughing.</p>
<p>"Yes, Captain Selwyn."</p>
<p>"Until you marry. Is that it, Eileen?"</p>
<p>"Yes, until I marry."</p>
<p>"And then we'll let each other go; is that it?"</p>
<p>"Yes. But I think I told you that I would never marry. Didn't
I?"</p>
<p>"Oh! Then ours is to be a lifelong and anti-sentimental
contract!"</p>
<p>"Yes, unless <i>you</i> marry."</p>
<p>"I promise not to," he said, "unless you do."</p>
<p>"I promise not to," she said gaily, "unless you do."</p>
<p>"There remains," he observed, "but one way for you and I ever to
marry anybody. And as I'm <i>hors de concours</i>, even that hope
is ended."</p>
<p>She flushed; her lips parted, but she checked what she had meant
to say, and they walked forward together in silence for a while
until she had made up her mind what to say and how to express
it:</p>
<p>"Captain Selwyn, there are two things that you do which seem to
me unfair. You still have, at times, that far-away, absent
expression which excludes me; and when I venture to break the
silence, you have a way of answering, 'Yes, child,' and 'No,
child'&mdash;as though you were inattentive, and I had not yet
become an adult. <i>That</i> is my first complaint! . . .
<i>What</i> are you laughing at? It is true; and it confuses and
hurts me; because I <i>know</i> I am intelligent enough and old
enough to&mdash;to be treated as a woman!&mdash;a woman attractive
enough to be reckoned with! But I never seem to be wholly so to
you."</p>
<p>The laugh died out as she ended; for a moment they stood there,
confronting one another.</p>
<p>"Do you imagine," he said in a low voice, "that I do not know
all that?"</p>
<p>"I don't know whether you do. For all your friendship&mdash;for
all your liking and your kindness to
me&mdash;somehow&mdash;I&mdash;I don't seem to stand with you as
other women do; I don't seem to stand their chances."</p>
<p>"What chances?"</p>
<p>"The&mdash;the consideration; you don't call any other woman
'child,' do you? You don't constantly remind other women of the
difference in your ages, do you? You don't <i>feel</i> with other
women that you are&mdash;as you please to call it&mdash;<i>hors de
concours</i>&mdash;out of the running. And somehow, with me, it
humiliates. Because even if I&mdash;if I am the sort of a girl who
never means to marry, you&mdash;your attitude seems to take away
the possibility of my changing my mind; it dictates to me, giving
me no choice, no liberty, no personal freedom in the matter. . . .
It's as though you considered me somehow utterly out of the
question&mdash;radically unthinkable as a woman. And you assume to
take for granted that I also regard you as&mdash;as <i>hors de
concours</i>. . . . Those are my grievances, Captain Selwyn. . . .
And I <i>don't</i> regard you so. And I&mdash;and it troubles me to
be excluded&mdash;to be found wanting, inadequate in anything that
a woman should be. I know that you and I have no desire to marry
each other&mdash;but&mdash;but please don't make the reason for it
either your age or my physical immaturity or intellectual
inexperience."</p>
<p>Another of those weather-stained seats of Georgia marble stood
embedded under the trees near where she had halted; and she seated
herself, outwardly composed, and inwardly a little frightened at
what she had said.</p>
<p>As for Selwyn, he remained where he had been standing on the
lawn's velvet edge; and, raising her eyes again, her heart misgave
her that she had wantonly strained a friendship which had been all
but perfect; and now he was moving across the path toward
her&mdash;a curious look in his face which she could not interpret.
She looked up as he approached and stretched out her hand:</p>
<p>"Forgive me, Captain Selwyn," she said. "I <i>am</i> a
child&mdash;a spoiled one; and I have proved it to you. Will you
sit here beside me and tell me very gently what a fool I am to risk
straining the friendship dearest to me in the whole world? And will
you fix my penance?"</p>
<p>"You have fixed it yourself," he said.</p>
<p>"How?"</p>
<p>"By the challenge of your womanhood."</p>
<p>"I did not challenge&mdash;"</p>
<p>"No; you defended. You are right. The girl I cared for&mdash;the
girl who was there with me on Brier Water&mdash;so many, many
centuries ago&mdash;the girl who, years ago, leaned there beside me
on the sun-dial&mdash;has become a memory."</p>
<p>"What do you mean?" she asked faintly.</p>
<p>"Shall I tell you?"</p>
<p>"Yes."</p>
<p>"You will not be unhappy if I tell you?"</p>
<p>"N-no."</p>
<p>"Have you any idea what I am going to say, Eileen?"</p>
<p>She looked up quickly, frightened at the tremor in his
voice:</p>
<p>"Don't&mdash;don't say it, Captain Selwyn!"</p>
<p>"Will you listen&mdash;as a penance?"</p>
<p>"I&mdash;no, I cannot&mdash;"</p>
<p>He said quietly: "I was afraid you could not listen. You see,
Eileen, that, after all, a man does know when he is done
for&mdash;"</p>
<p>"Captain Selwyn!" She turned and caught his hands in both of
hers, her eyes bright with tears: "Is that the penalty for what I
said? Did you think I invited this&mdash;"</p>
<p>"Invited! No, child," he said gently. "I was fool enough to
believe in myself; that is all. I have always been on the edge of
loving you. Only in dreams did I ever dare set foot across that
frontier. Now I have dared. I love you. That is all; and it must
not distress you."</p>
<p>"But it does not," she said; "I have always loved
you&mdash;dearly, dearly. . . . Not in that way. . . . I don't know
how. . . . Must it be in <i>that</i> way, Captain Selwyn? Can we
not go on in the other way&mdash;that dear way which I&mdash;I
have&mdash;almost spoiled? Must we be like other people&mdash;must
sentiment turn it all to commonplace? . . . Listen to me; I do love
you; it is perfectly easy and simple to say it. But it is not
emotional, it is not sentimental. Can't you see that in little
things&mdash;in my ways with you? I&mdash;if I were sentimental
about you I would call you Ph&mdash;by your first name, I suppose.
But I can't; I've tried to&mdash;and it's very, very hard&mdash;and
makes me self-conscious. It is an effort, you see&mdash;and so
would it be for me to think of you sentimentally. Oh, I couldn't! I
couldn't!&mdash;you, so much of a man, so strong and generous and
experienced and clever&mdash;so perfectly the embodiment of
everything I care for in a man! I love you dearly; but&mdash;you
saw! I could&mdash;could not bring myself to touch even your
hair&mdash;even in pure mischief. . . . And&mdash;sentiment chills
me; I&mdash;there are times when it would be unendurable&mdash;I
could not use an endearing term&mdash;nor suffer a&mdash;a caress.
. . . So you see&mdash;don't you? And won't you take me for what I
am?&mdash;and as I am?&mdash;a girl&mdash;still young, devoted to
you with all her soul&mdash;happy with you, believing implicitly in
you, deeply, deeply sensible of your goodness and sweetness and
loyalty to her. I am not a woman; I was a fool to say so. But
you&mdash;you are so overwhelmingly a man that if it were in me to
love&mdash;in that way&mdash;it would be you! . . . Do you
understand me? Or have I lost a friend? Will you forgive my foolish
boast? Can you still keep me first in your heart&mdash;as you are
in mine? And pardon in me all that I am not? Can you do these
things because I ask you?"</p>
<p>"Yes," he said.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_IX" id="CHAPTER_IX"></a>CHAPTER IX</h2>
<h3>A NOVICE</h3>
<p>Gerald came to Silverside two or three times during the early
summer, arriving usually on Friday and remaining until the
following Monday morning.</p>
<p>All his youthful admiration and friendship for Selwyn had
returned; that was plainly evident&mdash;and with it something less
of callow self-sufficiency. He did not appear to be as cock-sure of
himself and the world as he had been; there was less bumptiousness
about him, less aggressive complacency. Somewhere and somehow
somebody or something had come into collision with him; but who or
what this had been he did not offer to confide in Selwyn; and the
older man, dreading to disturb the existing accord between them,
forbore to question him or invite, even indirectly, any confidence
not offered.</p>
<p>Selwyn had slowly become conscious of this change in Gerald. In
the boy's manner toward others there seemed to be hints of that
seriousness which maturity or the first pressure of responsibility
brings, even to the more thoughtless. Plainly enough some
experience, not wholly agreeable, was teaching him the elements of
consideration for others; he was less impulsive, more tolerant;
yet, at times, Selwyn and Eileen also noticed that he became very
restless toward the end of his visits at Silverside; as though
something in the city awaited him&mdash;some duty, or
responsibility not entirely pleasant.</p>
<p>There was, too, something of soberness, amounting, at moments,
to discontented listlessness&mdash;not solitary brooding; for at
such moments he stuck to Selwyn, following him about and remaining
rather close to him, as though the elder man's mere presence was a
comfort&mdash;even a protection.</p>
<p>At such intervals Selwyn longed to invite the boy's confidence,
knowing that he had some phase of life to face for which his
experience was evidently inadequate. But Gerald gave no sign of
invitation; and Selwyn dared not speak lest he undo what time and
his forbearance were slowly repairing.</p>
<p>So their relations remained during the early summer; and
everybody supposed that Gerald's two weeks' vacation would be spent
there at Silverside. Apparently the boy himself thought so, too,
for he made some plans ahead, and Austin sent down a very handsome
new motor-boat for him.</p>
<p>Then, at the last minute, a telegram arrived, saying that he had
sailed for Newport on Neergard's big yacht! And for two weeks no
word was received from him at Silverside.</p>
<p>Late in August, however, he wrote a rather colourless letter to
Selwyn, saying that he was tired and would be down for the
week-end.</p>
<p>He came, thinner than usual, with the city pallor showing
through traces of the sea tan. And it appeared that he was really
tired; for he seemed inclined to lounge on the veranda, satisfied
as long as Selwyn remained in sight. But, when Selwyn moved, he got
up and followed.</p>
<p>So subdued, so listless, so gentle in manner and speech had he
become that somebody, in his temporary absence, wondered whether
the boy were perfectly well&mdash;which voiced the general doubt
hitherto unexpressed.</p>
<p>But Austin laughed and said that the boy was merely finding
himself; and everybody acquiesced, much relieved at the
explanation, though to Selwyn the explanation was not at all
satisfactory.</p>
<p>There was trouble somewhere, stress of doubt, pressure of
apprehension, the gravity of immaturity half realising its own
inexperience. And one day in September he wrote Gerald, asking him
to bring Edgerton Lawn and come down to Silverside for the purpose
of witnessing some experiments with the new smokeless explosive,
Chaosite.</p>
<p>Young Lawn came by the first train; Gerald wired that he would
arrive the following morning.</p>
<p>He did arrive, unusually pallid, almost haggard; and Selwyn, who
met him at the station and drove him over from Wyossett, ventured
at last to give the boy a chance.</p>
<p>But Gerald remained utterly unresponsive&mdash;stolidly
so&mdash;and the other instantly relinquished the hope of any
confidence at that time&mdash;shifting the conversation at once to
the object and reason of Gerald's coming, and gaily expressing his
belief that the time was very near at hand when Chaosite would
figure heavily in the world's list of commercially valuable
explosives.</p>
<p>It was early in August that Selwyn had come to the conclusion
that his Chaosite was likely to prove a commercial success. And
now, in September, his experiments had advanced so far that he had
ventured to invite Austin, Gerald, Lansing, and Edgerton Lawn, of
the Lawn Nitro-Powder Company, to witness a few tests at his
cottage laboratory on Storm Head; but at the same time he informed
them with characteristic modesty that he was not yet prepared to
guarantee the explosive.</p>
<p>About noon his guests arrived before the cottage in a solemn
file, halted, and did not appear overanxious to enter the
laboratory on Storm Head. Also they carefully cast away their
cigars when they did enter, and seated themselves in a nervous
circle in the largest room of the cottage. Here their eyes
instantly became glued to a great bowl which was piled high with
small rose-tinted cubes of some substance which resembled
symmetrical and translucent crystals of pink quartz. That was
Chaosite enough to blow the entire cliff into smithereens; and they
were aware of it, and they eyed it with respect.</p>
<p>First of all Selwyn laid a cubic crystal on an anvil, and struck
it sharply and repeatedly with a hammer. Austin's thin hair rose,
and Edgerton Lawn swallowed nothing several times; but nobody went
to heaven, and the little cube merely crumbled into a flaky pink
powder.</p>
<p>Then Selwyn took three cubes, dropped them into boiling milk,
fished them out again, twisted them into a waxy taper, placed it in
a candle-stick, and set fire to it. The taper burned with a flaring
brilliancy but without odour.</p>
<p>Then Selwyn placed several cubes in a mortar, pounded them to
powder with an iron pestle, and, measuring out the tiniest
pinch&mdash;scarcely enough to cover the point of a penknife,
placed a few grains in several paper cartridges. Two wads followed
the powder, then an ounce and a half of shot, then a wad, and then
the crimping.</p>
<p>The guests stepped gratefully outside; Selwyn, using a light
fowling-piece, made pattern after pattern for them; and then they
all trooped solemnly indoors again; and Selwyn froze Chaosite and
boiled it and baked it and melted it and took all sorts of
hair-raising liberties with it; and after that he ground it to
powder, placed a few generous pinches in a small hand-grenade, and
affixed a primer, the secret composition of which he alone knew.
That was the key to the secret&mdash;the composition of the primer
charge.</p>
<p>"I used to play base-ball in college," he observed
smiling&mdash;"and I used to be a pretty good shot with a
snowball."</p>
<p>They followed him to the cliff's edge, always with great respect
for the awful stuff he handled with such apparent carelessness.
There was a black sea-soaked rock jutting out above the waves;
Selwyn pointed at it, poised himself, and, with the long, overhand,
straight throw of a trained ball player, sent the grenade like a
bullet at the rock.</p>
<p>There came a blinding flash, a stunning, clean-cut
report&mdash;but what the others took to be a vast column of black
smoke was really a pillar of dust&mdash;all that was left of the
rock. And this slowly floated, settling like mist over the waves,
leaving nothing where the rock had been.</p>
<p>"I think," said Edgerton Lawn, wiping the starting perspiration
from his forehead, "that you have made good, Captain Selwyn. Dense
or bulk, your Chaosite and impact primer seem to do the business;
and I think I may say that the Lawn Nitro-Powder Company is ready
to do business, too. Can you come to town to-morrow? It's merely a
matter of figures and signatures now, if you say so. It is entirely
up to you."</p>
<p>But Selwyn only laughed. He looked at Austin.</p>
<p>"I suppose," said Edgerton Lawn good-naturedly, "that you intend
to make us sit up and beg; or do you mean to absorb us?"</p>
<p>But Selwyn said: "I want more time on this thing. I want to know
what it does to the interior of loaded shells and in fixed
ammunition when it is stored for a year. I want to know whether it
is necessary to use a solvent after firing it in big guns. As a
bursting charge I'm practically satisfied with it; but time is
required to know how it acts on steel in storage or on the bores of
guns when exploded as a propelling charge. Meanwhile," turning to
Lawn, "I'm tremendously obliged to you for coming&mdash;and for
your offer. You see how it is, don't you? I couldn't risk taking
money for a thing which might, at the end, prove dear at any
price."</p>
<p>"I cheerfully accept that risk," insisted young Lawn; "I am
quite ready to do all the worrying, Captain Selwyn."</p>
<p>But Selwyn merely shook his head, repeating: "You see how it is,
don't you?"</p>
<p>"I see that you possess a highly developed conscience," said
Edgerton Lawn, laughing; "and when I tell you that we are more than
willing to take every chance of failure&mdash;"</p>
<p>But Selwyn shook his head: "Not yet," he said; "don't worry; I
need the money, and I'll waste no time when a square deal is
possible. But I ought to tell you this: that first of all I must
offer it to the Government. That is only decent, you
see&mdash;"</p>
<p>"Who ever heard of the Government's gratitude?" broke in Austin.
"Nonsense, Phil; you are wasting time!"</p>
<p>"I've got to do it," said Selwyn; "you must see that, of
course."</p>
<p>"But I don't see it," began Lawn&mdash;"because you are not in
the Government service now&mdash;"</p>
<p>"Besides," added Austin, "you were not a West Pointer; you never
were under obligations to the Government!"</p>
<p>"Are we not all under obligation?" asked Selwyn so simply that
Austin flushed.</p>
<p>"Oh, of course&mdash;patriotism and all
that&mdash;naturally&mdash;Confound it, I don't suppose you'd go
and offer it to Germany or Japan before our own Government had the
usual chance to turn it down and break your heart. But why can't
the Government make arrangements with Lawn's Company&mdash;if it
desires to?"</p>
<p>"A man can't exploit his own Government; you all know that as
well as I do," returned Selwyn, smiling. "<i>Pro aris et focis</i>,
you know&mdash;<i>ex necessitate rei</i>."</p>
<p>"When the inventor goes to the Government," said Austin, with a
shrug&mdash;"<i>vestigia nulla retrorsum</i>."</p>
<p>"<i>Spero meliora</i>," retorted Selwyn, laughing; but there
remained the obstinate squareness of jaw, and his amused eyes were
clear and steady. Young Lawn looked into them and the hope in him
flickered; Austin looked, and shrugged; but as they all turned away
to retrace their steps across the moors in the direction of
Silverside, Lansing lightly hooked his arm into Selwyn's; and
Gerald, walking thoughtfully on the other side, turned over and
over in his mind the proposition offered him&mdash;the spectacle of
a modern and needy man to whom money appeared to be the last
consideration in a plain matter of business. Also he turned over
other matters in his mind; and moved closer to Selwyn, walking
beside him with grave eyes bent on the ground.</p>
<hr style='width: 45%;' />
<p>The matter of business arrangements apparently ended then and
there; Lawn's company sent several men to Selwyn and wrote him a
great many letters&mdash;unlike the Government, which had not
replied to his briefly tentative suggestion that Chaosite be
conditionally examined, tested, and considered.</p>
<p>So the matter remained in abeyance, and Selwyn employed two
extra men and continued storage tests and experimented with rifled
and smooth-bore tubes, watchfully uncertain yet as to the necessity
of inventing a solvent to neutralise possible corrosion after a
propelling charge had been exploded.</p>
<p>Everybody in the vicinity had heard about his experiments;
everybody pretended interest, but few were sincere; and of the
sincere, few were unselfishly interested&mdash;his sister, Eileen,
Drina, and Lansing&mdash;and maybe one or two others.</p>
<p>However, the younger set, now predominant from Wyossett to
Wonder Head, made up parties to visit Selwyn's cottage, which had
become known as The Chrysalis; and Selwyn good-naturedly exploded a
pinch or two of the stuff for their amusement, and never betrayed
the slightest annoyance or boredom. In fact, he behaved so amiably
during gratuitous interruptions that he won the hearts of the
younger set, who presently came to the unanimous conclusion that
there was Romance in the air. And they sniffed it with delicate
noses uptilted and liked the aroma.</p>
<p>Kathleen Lawn, a big, leisurely, blond-skinned girl, who showed
her teeth when she laughed and shook hands like a man, declared him
"adorable" but "unsatisfactory," which started one of the
Dresden-china twins, Dorothy Minster, and she, in turn, ventured
the innocent opinion that Selwyn was misunderstood by most
people&mdash;an inference that she herself understood him. And she
smiled to herself when she made this observation, up to her neck in
the surf; and Eileen, hearing the remark, smiled to herself, too.
But she felt the slightest bit uncomfortable when that animated
brunette Gladys Orchil, climbing up dripping on to the anchored
float beyond the breakers, frankly confessed that the tinge of
mystery enveloping Selwyn's career made him not only adorable, but
agreeably "unfathomable"; and that she meant to experiment with him
at every opportunity.</p>
<p>Sheila Minster, seated on the raft's edge, swinging her
stockinged legs in the green swells that swept steadily shoreward,
modestly admitted that Selwyn was "sweet," particularly in a canoe
on a moonlight night&mdash;in spite of her weighty mother heavily
afloat in the vicinity.</p>
<p>"He's nice every minute," she said&mdash;"every fibre of him is
nice in the nicest sense. He never talks 'down' at you&mdash;like
an insufferable undergraduate; and he is so much of a
man&mdash;such a real man!&mdash;that I like him," she added
na&iuml;vely; "and I'm quite sure he likes me, because he said
so."</p>
<p>"I like him," said Gladys Orchil, "because he has a sense of
humour and stands straight. I like a sense of humour and&mdash;good
shoulders. He's an enigma; and I like that, too. . . . I'm going to
investigate him every chance I get."</p>
<p>Dorothy Minster liked him, too: "He's such a regular boy at
times," she explained; "I do love to see him without his hat
sauntering along beside me&mdash;and not talking every minute when
you don't wish to talk. Friends," she added&mdash;"true friends are
most eloquent in their mutual silence. Ahem!"</p>
<p>Eileen Erroll, standing near on the pitching raft, listened
intently, but curiously enough said nothing either in praise or
blame.</p>
<p>"He is exactly the right age," insisted Gladys&mdash;as though
somebody had said he was not&mdash;"the age when a man is most
interesting."</p>
<p>The Minster twins twiddled their legs and looked sentimentally
at the ocean. They were a pair of pink and white little things with
china-blue eyes and the fairest of hair, and they were very
impressionable; and when they thought of Selwyn they looked
unutterable things at the Atlantic Ocean.</p>
<p>One man, often the least suitable, is usually the unanimous
choice of the younger sort where, in the disconcerting summer time,
the youthful congregate in garrulous segregation.</p>
<p>Their choice they expressed frankly and innocently; they
admitted cheerfully that Selwyn was their idol. But that gentleman
remained totally unconscious that he had been set up by them upon
the shores of the summer sea.</p>
<p>In leisure moments he often came down to the bathing-beach at
the hour made fashionable; he conducted himself amiably with
dowager and chaperon, with portly father and nimble brother, with
the late d&eacute;butantes of the younger set and the younger
matrons, individually, collectively, impartially.</p>
<p>He and Gerald usually challenged the rollers in a sponson canoe
when Gerald was there for the week-end; or, when Lansing came down,
the two took long swims seaward or cruised about in Gerald's dory,
clad in their swimming-suits; and Selwyn's youth became renewed in
a manner almost ridiculous, so that the fine lines which had
threatened the corners of his mouth and eyes disappeared, and the
clear sun tan of the tropics, which had never wholly faded, came
back over a smooth skin as clear as a boy's, though not as smoothly
rounded. His hair, too, crisped and grew lighter under the burning
sun, which revealed, at the temples, the slightest hint of silver.
And this deepened the fascination of the younger sort for the idol
they had set up upon the sands of Silverside.</p>
<p>Gladys was still eloquent on the subject, lying flat on the raft
where all were now gathered in a wet row, indulging in sunshine and
the two minutes of gossip which always preceded their return swim
to the beach.</p>
<p>"It is partly his hair," she said gravely, "that makes him so
distinguished in his appearance&mdash;just that touch of silver;
and you keep looking and looking until you scarcely know whether
it's really beginning to turn a little gray or whether it's only a
lighter colour at the temples. How insipid is a mere boy after such
a man as Captain Selwyn! . . . I have dreamed of such a
man&mdash;several times."</p>
<p>The Minster twins gazed soulfully at the Atlantic; Eileen Erroll
bit her under lip and stood up suddenly. "Come on," she said;
joined her hands skyward, poised, and plunged. One after another
the others followed and, rising to the surface, struck out
shoreward.</p>
<p>On the sunlit sands dozens of young people were hurling
tennis-balls at each other. Above the beach, under the long
pavilions, sat mothers and chaperons. Motors, beach-carts, and
victorias were still arriving to discharge gaily dressed
fashionables&mdash;for the hour was early&mdash;and up and down the
inclined wooden walk leading from the bathing-pavilion to the
sands, a constant procession of bathers passed with nod and gesture
of laughing salutation, some already retiring to the showers after
a brief ocean plunge, the majority running down to the shore, eager
for the first frosty and aromatic embrace of the surf rolling in
under a cloudless sky of blue.</p>
<p>As Eileen Erroll emerged from the surf and came wading shoreward
through the seething shallows, she caught sight of Selwyn
sauntering across the sands toward the water, and halted,
knee-deep, smilingly expectant, certain that he had seen her.</p>
<p>Gladys Orchil, passing her, saw Selwyn at the same moment, and
her clear, ringing salute and slender arm aloft, arrested his
attention; and the next moment they were off together, swimming
toward the sponson canoe which Gerald had just launched with the
assistance of Sandon Craig and Scott Innis.</p>
<p>For a moment Eileen stood there, motionless. Knee-high the flat
ebb boiled and hissed, dragging at her stockinged feet as though to
draw her seaward with the others. Yesterday she would have gone,
without a thought, to join the others; but yesterday is yesterday.
It seemed to her, as she stood there, that something disquieting
had suddenly come into the world; something unpleasant&mdash;but
indefinite&mdash;yet sufficient to leave her vaguely
apprehensive.</p>
<p>The saner emotions which have their birth in reason she was not
ignorant of; emotion arising from nothing at all disconcerted
her&mdash;nor could she comprehend the slight quickening of her
heart-beats as she waded to the beach, while every receding film of
water tugged at her limbs as though to draw her backward in the
wake of her unquiet thoughts.</p>
<p>Somebody threw a tennis-ball at her; she caught it and hurled it
in return; and for a few minutes the white, felt-covered balls flew
back and forth from scores of graceful, eager hands. A moment or
two passed when no balls came her way; she turned and walked to the
foot of a dune and seated herself cross-legged on the hot sand.</p>
<p>Sometimes she watched the ball players, sometimes she exchanged
a word of amiable commonplace with people who passed or halted to
greet her. But she invited nobody to remain, and nobody ventured
to, not even several very young and ardent gentlemen who had
acquired only the rudiments of social sense. For there was a sweet
but distant look in her dark-blue eyes and a certain reserved
preoccupation in her acknowledgment of salutations. And these kept
the would-be adorer moving&mdash;wistful, lagging, but still moving
along the edge of that invisible barrier set between her and the
world with her absent-minded greeting, and her serious, beautiful
eyes fixed so steadily on a distant white spot&mdash;the sponson
canoe where Gladys and Selwyn sat, their paddle blades flashing in
the sun.</p>
<p>How far away they were. . . . Gerald was with them. . . .
Curious that Selwyn had not seen her waiting for him, knee-deep in
the surf&mdash;curious that he had seen Gladys instead. . . . True,
Gladys had called to him and signalled him, white arm upflung. . .
. Gladys was very pretty&mdash;with her heavy, dark hair and
melting, Spanish eyes, and her softly rounded, olive-skinned
figure. . . . Gladys had called to him, and <i>she</i> had not. . .
. That was true; and lately&mdash;for the last few days&mdash;or
perhaps more&mdash;she herself had been a trifle less impulsive in
her greeting of Selwyn&mdash;a little less <i>sans-fa&ccedil;on</i>
with him. . . . After all, a man comes when it pleases him. Why
should a girl call him?&mdash;unless
she&mdash;unless&mdash;unless&mdash;</p>
<p>Perplexed, her grave eyes fixed on the sea where now the white
canoe pitched nearer, she dropped both hands to the
sand&mdash;those once wonderfully white hands, now creamed with sun
tan; and her arms, too, were tinted from shoulder to finger-tip.
Then she straightened her legs, crossed her feet, and leaned a
trifle forward, balancing her body on both palms flat on the sand.
The sun beat down on her; she loosened her hair to dry it, and as
she shook her delicate head the superb red-gold mass came tumbling
about her face and shoulders. Under its glimmering splendour, and
through it, she stared seaward out of wide, preoccupied eyes; and
in her breast, stirring uneasily, a pulse, intermittent yet dully
importunate, persisted.</p>
<p>The canoe, drifting toward the surf, was close in, now. Gerald
rose and dived; Gladys, steadying herself by a slim hand on
Selwyn's shoulder, stood up on the bow, ready to plunge clear when
the canoe capsized.</p>
<p>How wonderfully pretty she was, balanced there, her hand on his
shoulder, ready for a leap, lest the heavy canoe, rolling over in
the froth, strike her under the smother of foam and water. . . .
How marvellously pretty she was. . . . Her hand on his shoulder. .
. .</p>
<p>Miss Erroll sat very still; but the pulse within her was not
still.</p>
<p>When the canoe suddenly capsized, Gladys jumped, but Selwyn went
with it, boat and man tumbling into the tumult over and over; and
the usual laughter from the onlookers rang out, and a dozen young
people rushed into the surf to right the canoe and push it out into
the surf again and clamber into it.</p>
<p>Gerald was among the number; Gladys swam toward it, beckoning
imperiously to Selwyn; but he had his back to the sea and was
moving slowly out through the flat swirling ebb. And as Eileen
looked, she saw a dark streak leap across his face&mdash;saw him
stoop and wash it off and stand, looking blindly about, while again
the sudden dark line criss-crossed his face from temple to chin,
and spread wider like a stain.</p>
<p>"Philip!" she called, springing to her feet and scarcely knowing
that she had spoken.</p>
<p>He heard her, and came toward her in a halting, dazed way,
stopping twice to cleanse his face of the bright blood that
streaked it.</p>
<p>"It's nothing," he said&mdash;"the infernal thing hit me. . . .
Oh, don't use <i>that</i>!" as she drenched her kerchief in cold
sea-water and held it toward him with both hands.</p>
<p>"Take it!&mdash;I&mdash;I beg of you," she stammered. "Is it
s-serious?"</p>
<p>"Why, no," he said, his senses clearing; "it was only a rap on
the head&mdash;and this blood is merely a nuisance. . . . Thank
you, I will use your kerchief if you insist. . . . It'll stop in a
moment, anyway."</p>
<p>"Please sit here," she said&mdash;"here where I've been
sitting."</p>
<p>He did so, muttering: "What a nuisance. It will stop in a
second. . . . You needn't remain here with me, you know. Go in; it
is simply glorious."</p>
<p>"I've been in; I was drying my hair."</p>
<p>He glanced up, smiling; then, as the wet kerchief against his
forehead reddened, he started to rise, but she took it from his
fingers, hastened to the water's edge, rinsed it, and brought it
back cold and wet.</p>
<p>"Please sit perfectly still," she said; "a girl likes to do this
sort of thing for a man."</p>
<p>"If I'd known that," he laughed, "I'd have had it happen
frequently."</p>
<p>She only shook her head, watching him unsmiling. But the pulse
in her had become very quiet again.</p>
<p>"It's no end of fun in that canoe," he observed. "Gladys Orchil
and I work it beautifully."</p>
<p>"I saw you did," she nodded.</p>
<p>"Oh! Where were you? Why didn't you come?"</p>
<p>"I don't know. Gladys called you. I was waiting for
you&mdash;expecting you. Then Gladys called you."</p>
<p>"I didn't see you," he said.</p>
<p>"I didn't call you," she observed serenely. And, after a moment:
"Do you see only those who hail you, Captain Selwyn?"</p>
<p>He laughed: "In this life's cruise a good sailor always answers
a friendly hail."</p>
<p>"So do I," she said. "Please hail me after this&mdash;because I
don't care to take the initiative. If you neglect to do it, don't
count on my hailing you . . . any more."</p>
<p>The stain spread on the kerchief; once more she went to the
water's edge, rinsed it, and returned with it.</p>
<p>"I think it has almost stopped bleeding," she remarked as he
laid the cloth against his forehead. "You frightened me, Captain
Selwyn. I am not easily frightened."</p>
<p>"I know it."</p>
<p>"Did you know I was frightened?"</p>
<p>"Of course I did."</p>
<p>"Oh," she said, vexed, "how could you know it? I didn't do
anything silly, did I?"</p>
<p>"No; you very sensibly called me Philip. That's how I knew you
were frightened."</p>
<p>A slow bright colour stained face and neck.</p>
<p>"So I was silly, after all," she said, biting at her under lip
and trying to meet his humorous gray eyes with unconcern. But her
face was burning now, and, aware of it, she turned her gaze
resolutely on the sea. Also, to her further annoyance, her heart
awoke, beating unwarrantably, absurdly, until the dreadful idea
seized her that he could hear it. Disconcerted, she stood
up&mdash;a straight youthful figure against the sea. The wind
blowing her dishevelled hair across her cheeks and shoulders,
fluttered her clinging skirts as she rested both hands on her hips
and slowly walked toward the water's edge.</p>
<p>"Shall we swim?" he asked her.</p>
<p>She half turned and looked around and down at him.</p>
<p>"I'm all right; it's stopped bleeding. Shall we?" he inquired,
looking up at her. "You've got to wash your hair again,
anyhow."</p>
<p>She said, feeling suddenly stupid and childish, and knowing she
was speaking stupidly: "Would you not rather join Gladys again? I
thought that&mdash;that&mdash;"</p>
<p>"Thought <i>what</i>?"</p>
<p>"Nothing," she said, furious at herself; "I am going to the
showers. Good-bye."</p>
<p>"Good-bye," he said, troubled&mdash;"unless we walk to the
pavilion together&mdash;"</p>
<p>"But you are going in again; are you not?"</p>
<p>"Not unless you do."</p>
<p>"W-what have I to do with it, Captain Selwyn?"</p>
<p>"It's a big ocean&mdash;and rather lonely without you," he said
so seriously that she looked around again and laughed.</p>
<p>"It's full of pretty girls just now. Plunge in, my melancholy
friend. The whole ocean is a dream of fair women to-day."</p>
<p>"'If they be not fair to me, what care I how fair they be,'" he
paraphrased, springing to his feet and keeping step beside her.</p>
<p>"Really, that won't do," she said; "much moonlight and Gladys
and the Minster twins convict you. Do you remember that I told you
one day in early summer&mdash;that Sheila and Dorothy and Gladys
would mark you for their own? Oh, my inconstant courtier, they are
yonder!&mdash;And I absolve you. Adieu!"</p>
<p>"Do you remember what <i>I</i> told <i>you</i>&mdash;one day in
early summer?" he returned coolly.</p>
<p>Her heart began its absurd beating again&mdash;but now there was
no trace of pain in it&mdash;nothing of apprehension in the echo of
the pulse either.</p>
<p>"You protested so many things, Captain Selwyn&mdash;"</p>
<p>"Yes; and one thing in particular. You've forgotten it, I see."
And he looked her in the eye.</p>
<p>"No," she said, "you are wrong. I have not forgotten."</p>
<p>"Nor I."</p>
<p>He halted, looking out over the shining breakers. "I'm glad you
have not forgotten what I said; because, you see, I'm forbidden to
repeat it. So I shall be quite helpless to aid you in case your
memory fails."</p>
<p>"I don't think it will fail," she said, looking at the flashing
sea. A curious tingling sensation of fright had seized
her&mdash;something entirely unknown to her heretofore. She spoke
again because frightened; the heavy, hard pulse in breast and
throat played tricks with her voice and she swallowed and attempted
to steady it: "I&mdash;if&mdash;if I ever forget, you will know it
as soon as I do&mdash;"</p>
<p>Her throat seemed to close in a quick, unsteady breath; she
halted, both small hands clinched:</p>
<p>"<i>Don't</i> talk this way!" she said, exasperated under a rush
of sensations utterly incomprehensible&mdash;stinging, confused
emotions that beat chaotic time to the clamour of her pulses. "Why
d-do you speak of such things?" she repeated with a fierce little
indrawn breath&mdash;"why do you?&mdash;when you know&mdash;when I
said&mdash;explained everything?" She looked at him fearfully: "You
are somehow spoiling our friendship," she said; "and I don't
exactly know how you are doing it, but something of the comfort of
it is being taken away from me&mdash;and don't! don't! don't do
it!"</p>
<p>She covered her eyes with her clinched hands, stood a moment,
motionless; then her arms dropped, and she turned sharply with a
gesture which left him standing there and walked rapidly across the
beach to the pavilion.</p>
<p>After a little while he followed, pursuing his way very
leisurely to his own quarters. Half an hour later when she emerged
with her maid, Selwyn was not waiting for her as usual; and,
scarcely understanding that she was finding an excuse for
lingering, she stood for ten minutes on the step of the Orchils'
touring-car, talking to Gladys about the lantern f&ecirc;te and
dance to be given that night at Hitherwood House.</p>
<p>Evidently Selwyn had already gone home. Gerald came lagging up
with Sheila Minster; but his sister did not ask him whether Selwyn
had gone. Yesterday she would have done so; but to-day had brought
to her the strangest sensation of her young life&mdash;a sudden and
overpowering fear of a friend; and yet, strangest of all, the very
friend she feared she was waiting for&mdash;contriving to find
excuses to wait for. Surely he could not have finished dressing and
have gone. He had never before done that. Why did he not come? It
was late; people were leaving the pavilion; victorias and
beach-phaetons were trundling off loaded to the water-line with fat
dowagers; gay groups passed, hailing her or waving adieux; Drina
drove up in her village-cart, calling out: "Are you coming, Eileen,
or are you going to walk over? Hurry up! I'm hungry."</p>
<p>"I'll go with you," she said, nodding adieu to Gladys; and she
swung off the step and crossed the shell road.</p>
<p>"Jump in," urged the child; "I'm in a dreadful hurry, and Odin
can't trot very fast."</p>
<p>"I'd prefer to drive slowly," said Miss Erroll in a colourless
voice; and seated herself in the village-cart.</p>
<p>"Why must I drive slowly?" demanded the child. "I'm hungry;
besides, I haven't seen Boots this morning. I don't want to drive
slowly; must I?"</p>
<p>"Which are you most in a hurry for?" asked Eileen curiously;
"luncheon or Boots?"</p>
<p>"Both&mdash;I don't know. What a silly question. Boots of
course! But I'm starving, too."</p>
<p>"Boots? Of course?"</p>
<p>"Certainly. He always comes first&mdash;just like Captain Selwyn
with you."</p>
<p>"Like Captain Selwyn with me," she repeated absently;
"certainly; Captain Selwyn should be first, everything else second.
But how did you find out that, Drina?"</p>
<p>"Why, anybody can see that," said the child contemptuously; "you
are as fast friends with Uncle Philip as I am with Boots. And why
you don't marry him I can't see&mdash;unless you're not old enough.
Are you?"</p>
<p>"Yes. . . . I am old enough, dear."</p>
<p>"Then why don't you? If I was old enough to marry Boots I'd do
it. Why don't you?"</p>
<p>"I don't know," said Miss Erroll, as though speaking to
herself.</p>
<p>Drina glanced at her, then flourished her be-ribboned whip,
which whistling threat had no perceptible effect on the fat, red,
Norwegian pony.</p>
<p>"I'll tell you what," said the child, "if you don't ask Uncle
Philip pretty soon somebody will ask him first, and you'll be too
late. As soon as I saw Boots I knew that I wanted him for myself,
and I told him so. He said he was very glad I had spoken, because
he was expecting a proposal by wireless from the young
Sultana-elect of Leyte. Now," added the child with satisfaction,
"she can't have him. It's better to be in time, you see."</p>
<p>Eileen nodded: "Yes, it is better to be in plenty of time. You
can't tell what Sultana may forestall you."</p>
<p>"So you'll tell him, won't you?" inquired Drina with
business-like briskness.</p>
<p>Miss Erroll looked absently at her: "Tell who what?"</p>
<p>"Uncle Philip&mdash;that you're going to marry him when you're
old enough."</p>
<p>"Yes&mdash;when I'm old enough&mdash;I'll tell him, Drina."</p>
<p>"Oh, no; I mean you'll marry him when you're old enough, but
you'd better tell him right away."</p>
<p>"I see; I'd better speak immediately. Thank you, dear, for
suggesting it."</p>
<p>"You're quite welcome," said the child seriously; "and I hope
you'll be as happy as I am."</p>
<p>"I hope so," said Eileen as the pony-cart drew up by the veranda
and a groom took the pony's head.</p>
<p>Luncheon being the children's hour, Miss Erroll's silence
remained unnoticed in the jolly uproar; besides, Gerald and Boots
were discussing the huge house-party, lantern f&ecirc;te, and dance
which the Orchils were giving that night for the younger sets; and
Selwyn, too, seemed to take unusual interest in the discussion,
though Eileen's part in the conference was limited to an occasional
nod or monosyllable.</p>
<p>Drina was wild to go and furious at not having been asked, but
when Boots offered to stay home, she resolutely refused to accept
the sacrifice.</p>
<p>"No," she said; "they are pigs not to ask girls of my age, but
you may go, Boots, and I'll promise not to be unhappy." And she
leaned over and added in a whisper to Eileen: "You see how sensible
it is to make arrangements beforehand! Because somebody, grown-up,
might take him away at this very party. That's the reason why it is
best to speak promptly. Please pass me another peach, Eileen."</p>
<p>"What are you two children whispering about?" inquired Selwyn,
glancing at Eileen.</p>
<p>"Oho!" exclaimed Drina; "you may know before long! May he not,
Eileen? It's about you," she said; "something splendid that
somebody is going to do to you! Isn't it, Eileen?"</p>
<p>Miss Erroll looked smilingly at Selwyn, a gay jest on her lips;
but the sudden clamour of pulses in her throat closed her lips,
cutting the phrase in two, and the same strange fright seized
her&mdash;an utterly unreasoning fear of him.</p>
<p>At the same moment Mrs. Gerard gave the rising signal, and
Selwyn was swept away in the rushing herd of children, out on to
the veranda, where for a while he smoked and drew pictures for the
younger Gerards. Later, some of the children were packed off for a
nap; Billy with his assorted puppies went away with Drina and
Boots, ever hopeful of a fox or rabbit; Nina Gerard curled herself
up in a hammock, and Selwyn seated himself beside her, an uncut
magazine on his knees. Eileen had disappeared.</p>
<p>For a while Nina swung there in silence, her pretty eyes fixed
on her brother. He had nearly finished cutting the leaves of the
magazine before she spoke, mentioning the fact of Rosamund Fane's
arrival at the Minsters' house, Brookminster.</p>
<p>The slightest frown gathered and passed from her brother's
sun-bronzed forehead, but he made no comment.</p>
<p>"Mr. Neergard is a guest, too," she observed.</p>
<p>"What?" exclaimed Selwyn, in disgust.</p>
<p>"Yes; he came ashore with the Fanes."</p>
<p>Selwyn flushed a little but went on cutting the pages of the
magazine. When he had finished he flattened the pages between both
covers, and said, without raising his eyes:</p>
<p>"I'm sorry that crowd is to be in evidence."</p>
<p>"They always are and always will be," smiled his sister.</p>
<p>He looked up at her: "Do you mean that anybody <i>else</i> is a
guest at Brookminster?"</p>
<p>"Yes, Phil."</p>
<p>"Alixe?"</p>
<p>"Yes."</p>
<p>He looked down at the book on his knees and began to furrow the
pages absently.</p>
<p>"Phil," she said, "have you heard anything this
summer&mdash;lately&mdash;about the Ruthvens?"</p>
<p>"No."</p>
<p>"Nothing at all?"</p>
<p>"Not a word."</p>
<p>"You knew they were at Newport as usual."</p>
<p>"I took it for granted."</p>
<p>"And you have heard no rumours?&mdash;no gossip concerning them?
Nothing about a yacht?"</p>
<p>"Where was I to hear it? What gossip? What yacht?"</p>
<p>His sister said very seriously: "Alixe has been very
careless."</p>
<p>"Everybody is. What of it?"</p>
<p>"It is understood that she and Jack Ruthven have separated."</p>
<p>He looked up quickly: "Who told you that?"</p>
<p>"A woman wrote me from Newport. . . . And Alixe is here and Jack
Ruthven is in New York. Several people have&mdash;I have heard
about it from several sources. I'm afraid it's true, Phil."</p>
<p>They looked into each other's troubled eyes; and he said: "If
she has done this it is the worse of two evils she has chosen. To
live with him was bad enough, but this is the limit."</p>
<p>"I know it. She cannot afford to do such a thing again. . . .
Phil, what is the matter with her? She simply cannot be sane and do
such a thing&mdash;can she?"</p>
<p>"I don't know," he said.</p>
<p>"Well, I do. She is not sane. She has made herself horridly
conspicuous among conspicuous people; she has been indiscreet to
the outer edge of effrontery. Even that set won't stand it
always&mdash;especially as their men folk are quite crazy about
her, and she leads a train of them about wherever she
goes&mdash;the little fool!</p>
<p>"And now, if it's true, that there's to be a
separation&mdash;what on earth will become of her? I ask you, Phil,
for I don't know. But men know what becomes eventually of women who
slap the world across the face with over-ringed fingers.</p>
<p>"If&mdash;if there's any talk about it&mdash;if there's
newspaper talk&mdash;if there's a divorce&mdash;who will ask her to
their houses? Who will condone this thing? Who will tolerate it, or
her? Men&mdash;and men only&mdash;the odious sort that fawn on her
now and follow her about half-sneeringly. They'll tolerate it; but
their wives won't; and the kind of women who will receive and
tolerate her are not included in my personal experience. What a
fool she has been!&mdash;good heavens, what a fool!"</p>
<p>A trifle paler than usual, he said: "There is no real harm in
her. I know there is not."</p>
<p>"You are very generous, Phil&mdash;"</p>
<p>"No, I am trying to be truthful. And I say there is no harm in
her. I have made up my mind on that score." He leaned nearer his
sister and laid one hand on hers where it lay across the hammock's
edge:</p>
<p>"Nina; no woman could have done what she has done, and continue
to do what she does, and be mentally sound. This, at last, is my
conclusion."</p>
<p>"It has long been my conclusion," she said under her breath.</p>
<p>He stared at the floor out of gray eyes grown dull and
hopeless.</p>
<p>"Phil," whispered his sister, "suppose&mdash;suppose&mdash;what
happened to her father&mdash;"</p>
<p>"I know."</p>
<p>She said again: "It was slow at first, a brilliant
eccentricity&mdash;that gradually became&mdash;something else less
pleasant. Oh, Phil! Phil!"</p>
<p>"It was softening of the brain," he said, "was it not?"</p>
<p>"Yes&mdash;he entertained a delusion of conspiracy against
him&mdash;also a complacent conviction of the mental instability of
others. Yet, at intervals he remained clever and witty and
charming."</p>
<p>"And then?"</p>
<p>"Phil&mdash;he became violent at times."</p>
<p>"Yes. And the end?" he asked quietly.</p>
<p>"A little child again&mdash;quite happy and
content&mdash;playing with toys&mdash;very gentle, very
pitiable&mdash;" The hot tears filled her eyes. "Oh, Phil!" she
sobbed and hid her face on his shoulder.</p>
<p>Over the soft, faintly fragrant hair he stared stupidly, lips
apart, chin loose.</p>
<p>A little later, Nina sat up in the hammock, daintily effacing
the traces of tears. Selwyn was saying: "If this is so, that
Ruthven man has got to stand by her. Where could she go&mdash;if
such trouble is to come upon her? To whom can she turn if not to
him? He is responsible for her&mdash;doubly so, if her condition is
to be&mdash;<i>that</i>! By every law of manhood he is bound to
stand by her now; by every law of decency and humanity he cannot
desert her now. If she does these&mdash;these indiscreet
things&mdash;and if he knows she is not altogether mentally
responsible&mdash;he cannot fail to stand by her! How can he, in
God's name!"</p>
<p>"Phil," she said, "you speak like a man, but she has no man to
stand loyally by her in the direst need a human soul may know. He
is only a thing&mdash;no man at all&mdash;only a loathsome accident
of animated decadence."</p>
<p>He looked up quickly, amazed at her sudden bitterness; and she
looked back at him almost fiercely.</p>
<p>"I may as well tell you what I've heard," she said; "I was not
going to, at first; but it will be all around town sooner or later.
Rosamund told me. She learned&mdash;as she manages to learn
everything a little before anybody else hears of it&mdash;that Jack
Ruthven found out that Alixe was behaving very carelessly with some
man&mdash;some silly, callow, and probably harmless youth. But
there was a disgraceful scene on Mr. Neergard's yacht, the
<i>Niobrara</i>. I don't know who the people were, but Ruthven
acted abominably. . . . The <i>Niobrara</i> anchored in Widgeon Bay
yesterday; and Alixe is aboard, and her husband is in New York, and
Rosamund says he means to divorce her in one way or another! Ugh!
the horrible little man with his rings and bangles!"</p>
<p>She shuddered: "Why, the mere bringing of such a suit means her
social ruin no matter what verdict is brought in! Her only
salvation has been in remaining inconspicuous; and a sane girl
would have realised it. But"&mdash;and she made a gesture of
despair&mdash;"you see what she has done. . . . And Phil&mdash;you
know what she has done to you&mdash;what a mad risk she took in
going to your rooms that night&mdash;"</p>
<p>"Who said she had ever been in my rooms?" he demanded, flushing
darkly in his surprise.</p>
<p>"Did you suppose I didn't know it?" she asked quietly. "Oh, but
I did; and it kept me awake nights, worrying. Yet I knew it must
have been all right&mdash;knowing you as I do. But do you suppose
other people would hold you as innocent as I do? Even
Eileen&mdash;the sweetest, whitest, most loyal little soul in the
world&mdash;was troubled when Rosamund hinted at some scandal
touching you and Alixe. She told me&mdash;but she did not tell me
what Rosamund had said&mdash;the mischief maker!"</p>
<p>His face had become quite colourless; he raised an unsteady hand
to his mouth, touching his moustache; and his gray eyes narrowed
menacingly.</p>
<p>"Rosamund&mdash;spoke of scandal to&mdash;Eileen?" he repeated.
"Is that possible?"</p>
<p>"How long do you suppose a girl can live and not hear scandal of
some sort?" said Nina. "It's bound to rain some time or other, but
I prepared my little duck's back to shed some things."</p>
<p>"You say," insisted Selwyn, "that Rosamund spoke of me&mdash;in
that way&mdash;to Eileen?"</p>
<p>"Yes. It only made the child angry, Phil; so don't worry."</p>
<p>"No; I won't worry. No, I&mdash;I won't. You are quite right,
Nina. But the pity of it; that tight, hard-shelled woman of the
world&mdash;to do such a thing&mdash;to a young girl."</p>
<p>"Rosamund is Rosamund," said Nina with a shrug; "the antidote to
her species is obvious."</p>
<p>"Right, thank God!" said Selwyn between his teeth; "<i>Mens sana
in corpore sano</i>! bless her little heart! I'm glad you told me
this, Nina."</p>
<p>He rose and laughed a little&mdash;a curious sort of laugh; and
Nina watched him, perplexed.</p>
<p>"Where are you going, Phil?" she asked.</p>
<p>"I don't know. I&mdash;where is Eileen?"</p>
<p>"She's lying down&mdash;a headache; probably too much sun and
salt water. Shall I send for her?"</p>
<p>"No; I'll go up and inquire how she is. Susanne is there, isn't
she?"</p>
<p>And he entered the house and ascended the stairs.</p>
<p>The little Alsatian maid was seated in a corner of the upper
hall, sewing; and she informed Selwyn that mademoiselle "had bad in
ze h'ead."</p>
<p>But at the sound of conversation in the corridor Eileen's gay
voice came to them from her room, asking who it was; and she
evidently knew, for there was a hint of laughter in her tone.</p>
<p>"It is I. Are you better?" said Selwyn.</p>
<p>"Yes. D-did you wish to see me?"</p>
<p>"I always do."</p>
<p>"Thank you. . . . I mean, do you wish to see me now? Because I'm
very much occupied in trying to go to sleep."</p>
<p>"Yes, I wish to see you at once."</p>
<p>"Particularly?"</p>
<p>"Very particularly."</p>
<p>"Oh, if it's as serious as that, you alarm me. I'm afraid to
come."</p>
<p>"I'm afraid to have you. But please come."</p>
<p>He heard her laugh to herself; then her clear, amused voice:
"What are you going to say to me if I come out?"</p>
<p>"Something dreadful! Hurry!"</p>
<p>"Oh, if that's the case I'll hurry," she returned, and a moment
later the door opened and she emerged in a breezy flutter of
silvery ribbons and loosened ruddy hair.</p>
<p>She was dressed in some sort of delicate misty stuff that
alternately clung and floated, outlining or clouding her glorious
young figure as she moved with leisurely free-limbed grace across
the hall to meet him.</p>
<p>The pretty greeting she always reserved for him, even if their
separation had been for a few minutes only, she now offered, hand
extended; a cool, fragrant hand which lay for a second in his,
closed, and withdrew, leaving her eyes very friendly.</p>
<p>"Come out on the west veranda," she said; "I know what you wish
to say to me. Besides, I have something to confide to you, too. And
I'm very impatient to do it."</p>
<p>He followed her to the veranda; she seated herself in the broad
swing, and moved so that her invitation to him was unmistakable.
Then when he had taken the place beside her she turned toward him
very frankly, and he looked up to encounter her beautiful direct
gaze.</p>
<p>"What is disturbing our friendship?" she asked. "Do you know? I
don't. I went to my room after luncheon and lay down on my bed and
quietly deliberated. And do you know what conclusion I have
reached?"</p>
<p>"What?" he asked.</p>
<p>"That there is nothing at all to disturb our friendship. And
that what I said to you on the beach was foolish. I don't know why
I said it; I'm not the sort of girl who says such stupid
things&mdash;though I was apparently, for that one moment. And what
I said about Gladys was childish; I am not jealous of her, Captain
Selwyn. Don't think me silly or perverse or sentimental, will
you?"</p>
<p>"No, I won't."</p>
<p>She smiled at him with a trifle less courage&mdash;a trifle more
self-consciousness: "And&mdash;and as for what I called
you&mdash;"</p>
<p>"You mean when you called me by my first name, and I teased
you?"</p>
<p>"Y-es. I was silly to do it; sillier to be ashamed of doing it.
There's a great deal of the callow schoolgirl in me yet, you see.
The wise, amused smile of a man can sometimes stampede my
self-possession and leave me blushing like any ninny in dire
confusion. . . . It was very, very mean of you&mdash;for the blood
across your face did shock me. . . . And, by myself, and in my very
private thoughts, I do sometimes call you&mdash;by your first name.
. . . And that explains it. . . . Now, what have you to say to
me?"</p>
<p>"I wish to ask you something."</p>
<p>"With pleasure," she said; "go ahead." And she settled back,
fearlessly expectant.</p>
<p>"Very well, then," he said, striving to speak coolly. "It is
this: Will you marry me, Eileen?"</p>
<p>She turned perfectly white and stared at him, stunned. And he
repeated his question, speaking slowly, but unsteadily.</p>
<p>"N-no," she said; "I cannot. Why&mdash;why, you know that, don't
you?"</p>
<p>"Will you tell me why, Eileen?"</p>
<p>"I&mdash;I don't know why. I think&mdash;I suppose that it is
because I do not love you&mdash;that way."</p>
<p>"Yes," he said, "that, of course, is the reason. I
wonder&mdash;do you suppose that&mdash;in
time&mdash;perhaps&mdash;you might care for me&mdash;that way?"</p>
<p>"I don't know." She glanced up at him fearfully, fascinated, yet
repelled. "I don't know," she repeated pitifully. "Is
it&mdash;can't you help thinking of me in that way? Can't you be as
you were?"</p>
<p>"No, I can no longer help it. I don't want to help it,
Eileen."</p>
<p>"But&mdash;I wish you to," she said in a low voice. "It is that
which is coming between us. Oh, don't you see it is? Don't you feel
it&mdash;feel what it is doing to us? Don't you understand how it
is driving me back into myself? Whom am I to go to if not to you?
What am I to do if your affection turns into this&mdash;this
different attitude toward me? You were so perfectly sweet and
reasonable&mdash;so good, so patient; and now&mdash;and now I am
losing confidence in you&mdash;in myself&mdash;in our friendship.
I'm no longer frank with you; I'm afraid at times&mdash;afraid and
self-conscious&mdash;conscious of you, too&mdash;afraid of what
seemed once the most natural of intimacies. I&mdash;I loved you so
dearly&mdash;so fearlessly&mdash;"</p>
<p>Tears blinded her; she bent her head, and they fell on the soft
delicate stuff of her gown, flashing downward in the sunlight.</p>
<p>"Dear," he said gently, "nothing is altered between us. I love
you in that way, too."</p>
<p>"D-do you&mdash;really?" she stammered, shrinking away from
him.</p>
<p>"Truly. Nothing is altered; nothing of the bond between us is
weakened. On the contrary, it is strengthened. You cannot
understand that now. But what you are to believe and always
understand is that our friendship must endure. Will you believe
it?"</p>
<p>"Y-yes&mdash;" She buried her face in her handkerchief and sat
very still for a long time. He had risen and walked to the farther
end of the veranda; and for a minute he stood there, his narrowed
eyes following the sky flight of the white gulls off Wonder
Head.</p>
<p>When at length he returned to her she was sitting low in the
swing, both arms extended along the back of the seat. Evidently she
had been waiting for him; and her face was very grave and
sorrowful.</p>
<p>"I want to ask you something," she said&mdash;"merely to prove
that you are a little bit illogical. May I?"</p>
<p>He nodded, smiling.</p>
<p>"Could you and I care for each other more than we now do, if we
were married?"</p>
<p>"I think so," he said.</p>
<p>"Why?" she demanded, astonished. Evidently she had expected
another answer.</p>
<p>He made no reply; and she lay back among the cushions
considering what he had said, the flush of surprise still lingering
in her cheeks.</p>
<p>"How can I marry you," she asked, "when I would&mdash;would not
care to endure a&mdash;a caress from any man&mdash;even from you?
It&mdash;such things&mdash;would spoil it all. I <i>don't</i> love
you&mdash;that way. . . . Oh! <i>Don't</i> look at me that way!
Have I hurt you?&mdash;dear Captain Selwyn? . . . I did not mean
to. . . . Oh, what has become of our happiness! What has become of
it!" And she turned, full length in the swing, and hid her face in
the silken pillows.</p>
<p>For a long while she lay there, the western sun turning her
crown of hair to fire above the white nape of her slender neck; and
he saw her hands clasping, unclasping, or crushing the tiny
handkerchief deep into one palm.</p>
<p>There was a chair near; he drew it toward her, and sat down,
steadying the swing with one hand on the chain.</p>
<p>"Dearest," he said under his breath, "I am very selfish to have
done this; but I&mdash;I thought&mdash;perhaps&mdash;you might have
cared enough to&mdash;to venture&mdash;"</p>
<p>"I do care; you are very cruel to me." The voice was childishly
broken and muffled. He looked down at her, slowly realising that it
was a child he still was dealing with&mdash;a child with a child's
innocence, repelled by the graver phase of love, unresponsive to
the deeper emotions, bewildered by the glimpse of the mature
r&ocirc;le his attitude had compelled her to accept. That she
already had reached that mile-stone and, for a moment, had turned
involuntarily to look back and find her childhood already behind
her, frightened her.</p>
<p>Thinking, perhaps, of his own years, and of what lay behind him,
he sighed and looked out over the waste of moorland where the
Atlantic was battering the sands of Surf Point. Then his patient
gaze shifted to the east, and he saw the surface of Sky Pond, blue
as the eyes of the girl who lay crouching in the cushioned corner
of the swinging seat, small hands clinched over the
handkerchief&mdash;a limp bit of stuff damp with her tears.</p>
<p>"There is one thing," he said, "that we mustn't do&mdash;cry
about it&mdash;must we, Eileen?"</p>
<p>"No-o."</p>
<p>"Certainly not. Because there is nothing to make either of us
unhappy; is there?"</p>
<p>"Oh-h, no."</p>
<p>"Exactly. So we're not going to be unhappy; not one bit. First
because we love each other, anyway; don't we?"</p>
<p>"Y-yes."</p>
<p>"Of course we do. And now, just because I happen to love you in
that way and also in a different sort of way, in addition to that
way, why, it's nothing for anybody to cry about it; is it,
Eileen?"</p>
<p>"No. . . . No, it is not. . . . But I c-can't help it."</p>
<p>"Oh, but you're going to help it, aren't you?"</p>
<p>"I&mdash;I hope so."</p>
<p>He was silent; and presently she said: "I&mdash;the reason of
it&mdash;my crying&mdash;is b-b-because I don't wish you to be
unhappy."</p>
<p>"But, dear, dear little girl, I am not!"</p>
<p>"Really?"</p>
<p>"No, indeed! Why should I be? You do love me; don't you?"</p>
<p>"You know I do."</p>
<p>"But not in <i>that</i> way."</p>
<p>"N-no; not in <i>that</i> way. . . . I w-wish I did."</p>
<p>A thrill passed through him; after a moment he relaxed and
leaned forward, his chin resting on his clinched hands: "Then let
us go back to the old footing, Eileen."</p>
<p>"Can we?"</p>
<p>"Yes, we can; and we will&mdash;back to the old
footing&mdash;when nothing of deeper sentiment disturbed us. . . .
It was my fault, little girl. Some day you will understand that it
was not a wholly selfish fault&mdash;because I
believed&mdash;perhaps only dreamed&mdash;that I could make you
happier by loving you in&mdash;both ways. That is all; it is your
happiness&mdash;our happiness that we must consider; and if it is
to last and endure, we must be very, very careful that nothing
really disturbs it again. And that means that the love, which is
sometimes called friendship, must be recognised as sufficient. . .
. You know how it is; a man who is locked up in Paradise is never
satisfied until he can climb the wall and look over! Now I have
climbed and looked; and now I climb back into the garden of your
dear friendship, very glad to be there again with you&mdash;very,
very thankful, dear. . . . Will you welcome me back?"</p>
<p>She lay quite still a minute, then sat up straight, stretching
out both hands to him, her beautiful, fearless eyes brilliant as
rain-washed stars.</p>
<p>"Don't go away," she said&mdash;"don't ever go away from our
garden again."</p>
<p>"No, Eileen."</p>
<p>"Is it a promise . . . Philip?"</p>
<p>Her voice fell exquisitely low.</p>
<p>"Yes, a promise. Do you take me back, Eileen?"</p>
<p>"Yes; I take you. . . . Take me back, too, Philip." Her hands
tightened in his; she looked up at him, faltered, waited; then in a
fainter voice: "And&mdash;and be of g-good courage. . . . I&mdash;I
am not very old yet."</p>
<p>She withdrew her hands and bent her head, sitting there, still
as a white-browed novice, listlessly considering the lengthening
shadows at her feet. But, as he rose and looked out across the
waste with enchanted eyes that saw nothing, his heart suddenly
leaped up quivering, as though his very soul had been drenched in
immortal sunshine.</p>
<p>An hour later, when Nina discovered them there together, Eileen,
curled up among the cushions in the swinging seat, was reading
aloud "Evidences of Asiatic Influence on the Symbolism of Ancient
Yucatan"; and Selwyn, astride a chair, chin on his folded arms, was
listening with evident rapture.</p>
<p>"Heavens!" exclaimed Nina, "the blue-stocking and the
fogy!&mdash;and yours <i>are</i> pale blue, Eileen!&mdash;you're
about as self-conscious as Drina&mdash;slumping there with your
hair tumbling <i>&agrave; la</i> M&eacute;rode! Oh, it's very
picturesque, of course, but a straight spine and good grooming is
better. Get up, little blue-stockings and we'll have our hair
done&mdash;if you expect to appear at Hitherwood House with
me!"</p>
<p>Eileen laughed, calmly smoothing out her skirt over her slim
ankles; then she closed the book, sat up, and looked happily at
Selwyn.</p>
<p>"Fogy and <i>Bas-bleu</i>," she repeated. "But it <i>is</i>
fascinating, isn't it?&mdash;even if my hair is across my ears and
you sit that chair like a polo player! Nina, dearest, what is your
mature opinion concerning the tomoya and the Buddhist cross?"</p>
<p>"I know more about a tomboy-a than a tomoya, my saucy friend,"
observed Nina, surveying her with disapproval&mdash;"and I can be
as cross about it as any Buddhist, too. You are, to express it as
pleasantly as possible, a sight! Child, what on earth have you been
doing? There are two smears on your cheeks!"</p>
<p>"I've been crying," said the girl, with an amused sidelong
flutter of her lids toward Selwyn.</p>
<p>"Crying!" repeated Nina incredulously. Then, disarmed by the
serene frankness of the girl, she added: "A blue-stocking is bad
enough, but a grimy one is impossible. <i>Allons! Vite</i>!" she
insisted, driving Eileen before her; "the country is demoralising
you. Philip, we're dining early, so please make your arrangements
to conform. Come, Eileen; have you never before seen Philip
Selwyn?"</p>
<p>"I am not sure that I ever have," she replied, with a curious
little smile at Selwyn. Nina had her by the hand, but she dragged
back like a mischievously reluctant child hustled bedward:</p>
<p>"Good-bye," she said, stretching out her hand to
Selwyn&mdash;"good-bye, my unfortunate fellow fogy! I go, slumpy,
besmudged, but happy; I return, superficially immaculate&mdash;but
my stockings will still be blue! . . . Nina, dear, if you don't
stop dragging me I'll pick you up in my arms!&mdash;indeed I
will&mdash;"</p>
<p>There was a laugh, a smothered cry of protest; and Selwyn was
the amused spectator of his sister suddenly seized and lifted into
a pair of vigorous young arms, and carried into the house by this
tall, laughing girl who, an hour before, had lain there among the
cushions, frightened, unconvinced, clinging instinctively to the
last gay rags and tatters of the childhood which she feared were to
be stripped from her for ever.</p>
<p>It was clear starlight when they were ready to depart. Austin
had arrived unexpectedly, and he, Nina, Eileen, and Selwyn were to
drive to Hitherwood House, Lansing and Gerald going in the
motor-boat.</p>
<p>There was a brief scene between Drina and Boots&mdash;the former
fiercely pointing out the impropriety of a boy like Gerald being
invited where she, Drina, was ignored. But there was no use in
Boots offering to remain and comfort her as Drina had to go to bed,
anyway; so she kissed him good-bye very tearfully, and generously
forgave Gerald; and comforted herself before she retired by putting
on one of her mother's gowns and pinning up her hair and parading
before a pier-glass until her nurse announced that her bath was
waiting.</p>
<hr style='width: 45%;' />
<p>The drive to Hitherwood House was a dream of loveliness; under
the stars the Bay of Shoals sparkled in the blue darkness set with
the gemmed ruby and sapphire and emerald of ships' lanterns glowing
from unseen yachts at anchor.</p>
<p>The great flash-light on Wonder Head broke out in brilliancy,
faded, died to a cinder, grew perceptible again, and again blazed
blindingly in its endless monotonous routine; far lights twinkled
on the Sound, and farther away still, at sea. Then the majestic
velvety shadow of the Hither Woods fell over them; and they passed
in among the trees, the lamps of the depot wagon shining golden in
the forest gloom.</p>
<p>Selwyn turned instinctively to the young girl beside him. Her
face was in shadow, but she responded with the slightest movement
toward him:</p>
<p>"This dusk is satisfying&mdash;like sleep&mdash;this wide, quiet
shadow over the world. Once&mdash;and not so very long ago&mdash;I
thought it a pity that the sun should ever set. . . . I wonder if I
am growing old&mdash;because I feel the least bit tired to-night.
For the first time that I can remember a day has been a little too
long for me."</p>
<p>She evidently did not ascribe her slight sense of fatigue to the
scene on the veranda; perhaps she was too innocent to surmise that
any physical effect could follow that temporary stress of emotion.
A quiet sense of relief in relaxation from effort came over her as
she leaned back, conscious that there was happiness in rest and
silence and the soft envelopment of darkness.</p>
<p>"If it would only last," she murmured lazily.</p>
<p>"What, Eileen?"</p>
<p>"This heavenly darkness&mdash;and our drive, together. . . . You
are quite right not to talk to me; I won't, either. . . . Only I'll
drone on and on from time to time&mdash;so that you won't forget
that I am here beside you."</p>
<p>She lay so still for a while that at last Nina leaned forward to
look at her; then laughed.</p>
<p>"She's asleep," she said to Austin.</p>
<p>"No, I'm not," murmured the girl, unclosing her eyes; "Captain
Selwyn knows; don't you? . . . What is that sparkling&mdash;a
fire-fly?"</p>
<p>But it was the first paper lantern glimmering through the
Hitherwood trees from the distant lawn.</p>
<p>"Oh, dear," sighed Eileen, sitting up with an effort, and
looking sleepily at Selwyn. "<i>J'ai
sommeil&mdash;besoin&mdash;dormir</i>&mdash;"</p>
<p>But a few minutes later they were in the great hall of
Hitherwood House, opened from end to end to the soft sea wind, and
crowded with the gayest, noisiest throng that had gathered there in
a twelvemonth.</p>
<p>Everywhere the younger set were in evidence; slim, fresh,
girlish figures passed and gathered and crowded the stairs and
galleries with a flirt and flutter of winnowing skirts, delicate
and light as powder-puffs.</p>
<p>Mrs. Sanxon Orchil, a hard, highly coloured, tight-lipped little
woman with electric-blue eyes, was receiving with her slim brunette
daughter, Gladys.</p>
<p>"A tight little craft," was Austin's invariable comment on the
matron; and she looked it, always trim and trig and smooth of
surface like a converted yacht cleared for action.</p>
<p>Near her wandered her husband, orientally bland, invariably
affable, and from time to time squinting sideways, as usual, in the
ever-renewed expectation that he might catch a glimpse of his
stiff, retrouss&eacute; moustache.</p>
<p>The Lawns were there, the Minsters, the Craigs from Wyossett,
the Grays of Shadow Lake, the Draymores, Fanes, Mottlys,
Cardwells&mdash;in fact, it seemed as though all Long Island had
been drained from Cedarhurst to Islip and from Oyster Bay to
Wyossett, to pour a stream of garrulous and animated youth and
beauty into the halls and over the verandas and terraces and lawns
of Hitherwood House.</p>
<p>It was to be a lantern frolic and a lantern dance and supper,
all most formally and impressively <i>sans fa&ccedil;on</i>. And it
began with a candle-race for a big silver gilt cup&mdash;won by
Sandon Craig and his partner, Evelyn Cardwell, who triumphantly
bore their lighted taper safely among the throngs of hostile
contestants, through the wilderness of flitting lights, and across
the lawn to the goal where they planted it, unextinguished, in the
big red paper lantern.</p>
<p>Selwyn and Eileen came up breathless and laughing with the
others, she holding aloft their candle, which somebody had
succeeded in blowing out; and everybody cheered the winners,
significantly, for it was expected that Miss Cardwell's engagement
to young Craig would be announced before very long.</p>
<p>Then rockets began to rush aloft, starring the black void with
iridescent fire; and everybody went to the lawn's edge where, below
on the bay, a dozen motor-boats, dressed fore and aft with
necklaces of electric lights, crossed the line at the crack of a
cannon in a race for another trophy.</p>
<p>Bets flew as the excitement grew, Eileen confining hers to
gloves and bonbons, and Selwyn loyally taking any offers of any
kind as he uncompromisingly backed Gerald and Boots in the new
motor-boat&mdash;the <i>Blue Streak</i>&mdash;Austin's contribution
to the Silverside navy.</p>
<p>And sure enough, at last a blue rocket soared aloft, bursting
into azure magnificence in the zenith; and Gerald and Boots came
climbing up to the lawn to receive prize and compliments, and
hasten away to change their oilskins for attire more suitable.</p>
<p>Eileen, turning to Selwyn, held up her booking list in laughing
dismay: "I've won about a ton of bonbons," she said, "and too many
pairs of gloves to feel quite comfortable."</p>
<p>"You needn't wear them all at once, you know," he assured
her.</p>
<p>"Nonsense! I mean that I don't care to win things.
Oh!"&mdash;and she laid her hand impulsively on his arm as a huge
sheaf of rockets roared skyward, apparently from the water.</p>
<p>Then, suddenly, Neergard's yacht sprang into view, outlined in
electricity from stem to stern, every spar and funnel and contour
of hull and superstructure twinkling in jewelled brilliancy.</p>
<p>On a great improvised open pavilion set up in the Hither Woods,
garlanded and hung thick with multi-coloured paper lanterns,
dancing had already begun; but Selwyn and Eileen lingered on the
lawn for a while, fascinated by the beauty of the fireworks pouring
skyward from the <i>Niobrara</i>.</p>
<p>"They seem to be very gay aboard her," murmured the girl. "Once
you said that you did not like Mr. Neergard. Do you remember saying
it?"</p>
<p>He replied simply, "I don't like him; and I remember saying
so."</p>
<p>"It is strange," she said, "that Gerald does."</p>
<p>Selwyn looked at the illuminated yacht. . . . "I wonder whether
any of Neergard's crowd is expected ashore here. Do you happen to
know?"</p>
<p>She did not know. A moment later, to his annoyance, Edgerton
Lawn came up and asked her to dance; and she went with a smile and
a whispered: "Wait for me&mdash;if you don't mind. I'll come back
to you."</p>
<p>It was all very well to wait for her&mdash;and even to dance
with her after that; but there appeared to be no peace for him in
prospect, for Scott Innis came and took her away, and Gladys Orchil
offered herself to him very prettily, and took him away; and after
that, to his perplexity and consternation, a perfect furor for him
seemed to set in and grow among the younger set, and the Minster
twins had him, and Hilda Innis appropriated him, and Evelyn
Cardwell, and even Mrs. Delmour-Carnes took a hand in the
badgering.</p>
<p>At intervals he caught glimpses of Eileen through the gay crush
around him; he danced with Nina, and suggested to her it was time
to leave, but that young matron had tasted just enough to want
more; and Eileen, too, was evidently having a most delightful time.
So he settled into the harness of pleasure and was good to the
pink-and-white ones; and they told each other what a "dear" he was,
and adored him more inconveniently than ever.</p>
<p>Truly enough, as he had often said, these younger ones were the
charmingly wholesome and refreshing antidote to the occasional
misbehaviour of the mature. They were, as he also asserted, the
hope and promise of the social fabric of a nation&mdash;this
younger set&mdash;always a little better, a little higher-minded
than their predecessors as the wheel of the years slowly turned
them out in gay, eager, fearless throngs to teach a cynical
generation the rudiments of that wisdom which blossoms most
perfectly in the hearts of the unawakened.</p>
<p>Yes, he had frequently told himself all this; told it to others,
too. But, now, the younger set, <i>en masse</i> and in detail, had
become a little bit <i>cramponn&eacute;</i>&mdash;a trifle too
all-pervading. And it was because his regard for them, in the
abstract, had become centred in a single concrete example that he
began to find the younger set a nuisance. But others, it seemed,
were quite as mad about Eileen Erroll as he was; and there seemed
to be small chance for him to possess himself of her, unless he
were prepared to make the matter of possession a pointed episode.
This he knew he had no right to do; she had conferred no such
privilege upon him; and he was obliged to be careful of what he did
and said lest half a thousand bright unwinking eyes wink too
knowingly&mdash;lest frivolous tongues go clip-clap, and idle
brains infer that which, alas! did not exist except in his vision
of desire.</p>
<p>The Hither Woods had been hung with myriads of lanterns. From
every branch they swung in clusters or stretched away into
perspective, turning the wooded aisles to brilliant vistas. Under
them the more romantic and the dance-worn strolled in animated
groups or quieter twos; an army of servants flitted hither and
thither, serving the acre or so of small tables over each of which
an electric cluster shed yellow light.</p>
<p>Supper, and then the Woodland cotillon was the programme; and
almost all the tables were filled before Selwyn had an opportunity
to collect Nina and Austin and capture Eileen from a very
rosy-cheeked and indignant boy who had quite lost his head and
heart and appeared to be on the verge of a headlong
declaration.</p>
<p>"It's only Percy Draymore's kid brother," she explained, passing
her arm through his with a little sigh of satisfaction. "Where have
you been all the while?&mdash;and with whom have you danced,
please?&mdash;and who is the pretty girl you paid court to during
that last dance? What? <i>Didn't</i> pay court to her? Do you
expect me to believe that? . . . Oh, here comes Nina and Austin. .
. . How pretty the tables look, all lighted up among the trees! And
such an uproar!"&mdash;as they came into the jolly tumult and
passed in among a labyrinth of tables, greeted laughingly from
every side.</p>
<p>Under a vigorous young oak-tree thickly festooned with lanterns
Austin found an unoccupied table. There was a great deal of racket
and laughter from the groups surrounding them, but this seemed to
be the only available spot; besides, Austin was hungry, and he said
so.</p>
<p>Nina, with Selwyn on her left, looked around for Gerald and
Lansing. When the latter came sauntering up, Austin questioned him,
but he replied carelessly that Gerald had gone to join some people
whom he, Lansing, did not know very well.</p>
<p>"Why, there he is now!" exclaimed Eileen, catching sight of her
brother seated among a very noisy group on the outer edge of the
illuminated zone. "Who are those people, Nina? Oh! Rosamund Fane is
there, too; and&mdash;and&mdash;"</p>
<p>She ceased speaking so abruptly that Selwyn turned around; and
Nina bit her lip in vexation and glanced at her husband. For, among
the overanimated and almost boisterous group which was attracting
the attention of everybody in the vicinity sat Mrs. Jack Ruthven.
And Selwyn saw her.</p>
<p>For a moment he looked at her&mdash;looked at Gerald beside her,
and Neergard on the other side, and Rosamund opposite; and at the
others, whom he had never before seen. Then quietly, but with
heightened colour, he turned his attention to the glass which the
servant had just filled for him, and, resting his hand on the stem,
stared at the bubbles crowding upward through it to the foamy
brim.</p>
<p>Nina and Boots had begun, ostentatiously, an exceedingly
animated conversation; and they became almost aggressive, appealing
to Austin, who sat back with a frown on his heavy face&mdash;and to
Eileen, who was sipping her mineral water and staring thoughtfully
at a big, round, orange-tinted lantern which hung like the harvest
moon behind Gerald, throwing his curly head into silhouette.</p>
<div class="figcenter"><a href=
"images/facing_page368.jpg"><img src="images/facing_page368.jpg"
width="80%" alt="" title="" /></a><br />
<b>"Gerald beside her, and Neergard on the other side."</b>
<br /></div>
<p>What conversation there was to carry, Boots and Nina carried.
Austin silently satisfied his hunger, eating and drinking with a
sullen determination to make no pretence of ignoring a situation
that plainly angered him deeply. And from minute to minute he
raised his head to glare across at Gerald, who evidently was
unconscious of the presence of his own party.</p>
<p>When Nina spoke to Eileen, the girl answered briefly but with
perfect composure. Selwyn, too, added a quiet word at intervals,
speaking in a voice that sounded a little tired and strained.</p>
<p>It was that note of fatigue in his voice which aroused Eileen to
effort&mdash;the instinctive move to protect&mdash;to sustain him.
Conscious of Austin's suppressed but increasing anger at her
brother, amazed and distressed at what Gerald had done&mdash;for
the boy's very presence there was an affront to them all&mdash;she
was still more sensitive to Selwyn's voice; and in her heart she
responded passionately.</p>
<p>Nina looked up, surprised at the sudden transformation in the
girl, who had turned on Boots with a sudden flow of spirits and the
gayest of challenges; and their laughter and badinage became so
genuine and so persistent that, combining with Nina, they fairly
swept Austin from his surly abstraction into their toils; and
Selwyn's subdued laugh, if forced, sounded pleasantly, now, and his
drawn face seemed to relax a little for the time being.</p>
<p>Once she turned, under cover of the general conversation which
she had set going, and looked straight into Selwyn's eyes, flashing
to him a message of purest loyalty; and his silent gaze in response
sent the colour flying to her cheeks.</p>
<p>It was all very well for a while&mdash;a brave, sweet effort;
but ears could not remain deaf to the increasing noise and
laughter&mdash;to familiar voices, half-caught phrases, indiscreet
even in the fragments understood. Besides, Gerald had seen them,
and the boy's face had become almost ghastly.</p>
<p>Alixe, unusually flushed, was conducting herself without
restraint; Neergard's snickering laugh grew more significant and
persistent; even Rosamund spoke too loudly at moments; and once she
looked around at Nina and Selwyn while her pretty, accentless
laughter, rippling with its undertone of malice, became more
frequent in the increasing tumult.</p>
<p>There was no use in making a pretence of further gaiety. Austin
had begun to scowl again; Nina, with one shocked glance at Alixe,
leaned over toward her brother:</p>
<p>"It is incredible!" she murmured; "she must be perfectly mad to
make such an exhibition of herself. Can't anybody stop her? Can't
anybody send her home?"</p>
<p>Austin said sullenly but distinctly: "The thing for us to do is
to get out. . . . Nina&mdash;if you are ready&mdash;"</p>
<p>"But&mdash;but what about Gerald?" faltered Eileen, turning
piteously to Selwyn. "We can't leave him&mdash;there!"</p>
<p>The man straightened up and turned his drawn face toward
her:</p>
<p>"Do you wish me to get him?"</p>
<p>"Y-you can't do that&mdash;can you?"</p>
<p>"Yes, I can; if you wish it. Do you think there is anything in
the world I can't do, if you wish it?"</p>
<p>As he rose she laid her hand on his arm:</p>
<p>"I&mdash;I don't ask it&mdash;" she began.</p>
<p>"You do not have to ask it," he said with a smile almost
genuine. "Austin, I'm going to get Gerald&mdash;and Nina will
explain to you that he's to be left to me if any sermon is
required. I'll go back with him in the motor-boat. Boots, you'll
drive home in my place."</p>
<p>As he turned, still smiling and self-possessed, Eileen whispered
rapidly: "Don't go. I care for you too much to ask it."</p>
<p>He said under his breath: "Dearest, you cannot understand."</p>
<p>"Yes&mdash;I do! Don't go. Philip&mdash;don't go
near&mdash;her&mdash;"</p>
<p>"I must."</p>
<p>"If you do&mdash;if you go&mdash;h-how can you c-care for me as
you say you do?&mdash;when I ask you not to&mdash;when I cannot
endure&mdash;to&mdash;"</p>
<p>She turned swiftly and stared across at Alixe; and Alixe,
unsteady in the flushed brilliancy of her youthful beauty, half
rose in her seat and stared back.</p>
<p>Instinctively the young girl's hand tightened on Selwyn's arm:
"She&mdash;she is beautiful!" she faltered; but he turned and led
her from the table, following Austin, his sister, and Lansing; and
she clung to him almost convulsively when he halted on the edge of
the lawn.</p>
<p>"I must go back," he
whispered&mdash;"dearest&mdash;dearest&mdash;I must."</p>
<p>"T-to Gerald? Or&mdash;<i>her</i>?"</p>
<p>But he only muttered: "They don't know what they're doing. Let
me go, Eileen"&mdash;gently detaching her fingers, which left her
hands lying in both of his.</p>
<p>She said, looking up at him: "If you go&mdash;if you
go&mdash;whatever time you return&mdash;no matter what
hour&mdash;knock at my door. Do you promise? I shall be awake. Do
you promise?"</p>
<p>"Yes," he said with a trace of impatience&mdash;the only hint of
his anger at the prospect of the duty before him.</p>
<p>So she went away with Nina and Austin and Boots; and Selwyn
turned back, sauntering quietly toward the table where already the
occupants had apparently forgotten him and the episode in the
riotous gaiety increasing with the accession of half a dozen more
men.</p>
<p>When Selwyn approached, Neergard saw him first, stared at him,
and snickered; but he greeted everybody with smiling composure,
nodding to those he knew&mdash;a trifle more formally to Mrs.
Ruthven&mdash;and, coolly pulling up a chair, seated himself beside
Gerald.</p>
<p>"Boots has driven home with the others," he said in a low voice;
"I'm going back in the motor-boat with you. Don't worry about
Austin. Are you ready?"</p>
<p>The boy had evidently let the wine alone, or else fright had
sobered him, for he looked terribly white and tired: "Yes," he
said, "I'll go when you wish. I suppose they'll never forgive me
for this. Come on."</p>
<p>"One moment, then," nodded Selwyn; "I want to speak to Mrs.
Ruthven." And, quietly turning to Alixe, and dropping his voice to
a tone too low for Neergard to hear&mdash;for he was plainly
attempting to listen:</p>
<p>"You are making a mistake; do you understand? Whoever is your
hostess&mdash;wherever you are staying&mdash;find her and go there
before it is too late."</p>
<p>She inclined her pretty head thoughtfully, eyes on the
wine-glass which she was turning round and round between her
slender fingers. "What do you mean by 'too late'?" she asked.
"Don't you know that everything is too late for me now?"</p>
<p>"What do <i>you</i> mean, Alixe?" he returned, watching her
intently.</p>
<p>"What I say. I have not seen Jack Ruthven for two months. Do you
know what that means? I have not heard from him for two months. Do
you know what <i>that</i> means? No? Well, I'll tell you, Philip;
it means that when I do hear from him it will be through his
attorneys."</p>
<p>He turned slightly paler: "Why"?"</p>
<p>"Divorce," she said with a reckless little laugh&mdash;"and the
end of things for me."</p>
<p>"On what grounds?" he demanded doggedly. "Does he threaten
you?"</p>
<p>She made no movement or reply, reclining there, one hand on her
wine-glass, the smile still curving her lips. And he repeated his
question in a low, distinct voice&mdash;too low for Neergard to
hear; and he was still listening.</p>
<p>"Grounds? Oh, he thinks I've misbehaved with&mdash;never mind
who. It is not true&mdash;but he cares nothing about that, either.
You see"&mdash;and she bent nearer, confidentially, with a
mysterious little nod of her pretty head&mdash;"you see, Jack
Ruthven is a little insane. . . . You are surprised? Pooh! I've
suspected it for months."</p>
<p>He stared at her; then: "Where are you stopping?"</p>
<p>"Aboard the <i>Niobrara</i>."</p>
<p>"Is Mrs. Fane a guest there, too?"</p>
<p>He spoke loud enough for Rosamund to hear; and she answered for
herself with a smile at him, brimful of malice:</p>
<p>"Delighted to have you come aboard, Captain Selwyn. Is that what
you are asking permission to do?"</p>
<p>"Thanks," he returned dryly; and to Alixe: "If you are ready,
Gerald and I will take you over to the <i>Niobrara</i> in the
motor-boat&mdash;"</p>
<p>"Oh, no, you won't!" broke in Neergard with a
sneer&mdash;"you'll mind your own business, my intrusive friend,
and I'll take care of my guests without your assistance."</p>
<p>Selwyn appeared not to hear him: "Come on, Gerald," he said
pleasantly; "Mrs. Ruthven is going over to the
<i>Niobrara</i>&mdash;"</p>
<p>"For God's sake," whispered Gerald, white as a sheet, "don't
force me into trouble with Neergard."</p>
<p>Selwyn turned on him an astonished gaze: "Are you <i>afraid</i>
of that whelp?"</p>
<p>"Yes," muttered the boy&mdash;"I&mdash;I'll explain later. But
don't force things now, I beg you."</p>
<p>Mrs. Ruthven coolly leaned over and spoke to Gerald in a low
voice; then, to Selwyn, she said with a smile: "Rosamund and I are
going to Brookminster, anyway, so you and Gerald need not wait. . .
. And thank you for coming over. It was rather nice of
you"&mdash;she glanced insolently at Neergard&mdash;"considering
the crowd we're with. <i>Good</i>-night, Captain Selwyn!
<i>Good</i>-night, Gerald. So very jolly to have seen you again!"
And, under her breath to Selwyn: "You need not worry; I am going in
a moment. Good-bye and&mdash;thank you, Phil. It <i>is</i> good to
see somebody of one's own caste again."</p>
<p>A few moments later, Selwyn and Gerald in their oilskins were
dashing eastward along the coast in the swiftest motor-boat south
of the Narrows.</p>
<hr style='width: 45%;' />
<p>The boy seemed deathly tired as they crossed the dim lawn at
Silverside. Once, on the veranda steps he stumbled, and Selwyn's
arm sustained him; but the older man forbore to question him, and
Gerald, tight-lipped and haggard, offered no confidence until, at
the door of his bedroom, he turned and laid an unsteady hand on
Selwyn's shoulder: "I want to talk with you&mdash;to-morrow. May
I?"</p>
<p>"You know you may, Gerald. I am always ready to stand your
friend."</p>
<p>"I know. . . . I must have been crazy to doubt it. You are very
good to me. I&mdash;I am in a very bad fix. I've got to tell
you."</p>
<p>"Then we'll get you out of it, old fellow," said Selwyn
cheerfully. "That's what friends are for, too."</p>
<p>The boy shivered&mdash;looked at the floor, then, without
raising his eyes, said good-night, and, entering his bedroom,
closed the door.</p>
<p>As Selwyn passed back along the corridor, the door of his
sister's room opened, and Austin and Nina confronted him.</p>
<p>"Has that damfool boy come in?" demanded his brother-in-law,
anxiety making his voice tremulous under its tone of contempt.</p>
<p>"Yes. Leave him to me, please. Good-night"&mdash;submitting to a
tender embrace from his sister&mdash;"I suppose Eileen has retired,
hasn't she? It's an ungodly hour&mdash;almost sunrise."</p>
<p>"I don't know whether Eileen is asleep," said Nina; "she
expected a word with you, I understand. But don't sit
up&mdash;don't let her sit up late. We'll be a company of dreadful
wrecks at breakfast, anyway."</p>
<p>And his sister gently closed the door while he continued on to
the end of the corridor and halted before Eileen's room. A light
came through the transom; he waited a moment, then knocked very
softly.</p>
<p>"Is it you?" she asked in a low voice.</p>
<p>"Yes. I didn't wake you, did I?"</p>
<p>"No. Is Gerald here?"</p>
<p>"Yes, in his own room. . . . Did you wish to speak to me about
anything?"</p>
<p>"Yes."</p>
<p>He heard her coming to the door; it opened a very little.
"Good-night," she whispered, stretching toward him her
hand&mdash;"that was all I wanted&mdash;to&mdash;to touch you
before I closed my eyes to-night."</p>
<p>He bent and looked at the hand lying within his own&mdash;the
little hand with its fresh fragrant palm upturned and the white
fingers relaxed, drooping inward above it&mdash;at the delicate
bluish vein in the smooth wrist.</p>
<p>Then he released the hand, untouched by his lips; and she
withdrew it and closed the door; and he heard her laugh softly, and
lean against it, whispering:</p>
<p>"Now that I am safely locked in&mdash;I merely wish to say
that&mdash;in the old days&mdash;a lady's hand was
sometimes&mdash;kissed. . . . Oh, but you are too late, my poor
friend! I can't come out; and I wouldn't if I could&mdash;not after
what I dared to say to you. . . . In fact, I shall probably remain
locked up here for days and days. . . . Besides, what I said is out
of fashion&mdash;has no significance nowadays&mdash;or, perhaps,
too much. . . . No, I won't dress and come out&mdash;even for you.
<i>Je me d&eacute;shabille&mdash;je fais ma toilette de nuit,
monsieur&mdash;et je vais maintenant m'agenouiller et faire ma
pri&egrave;re. Donc&mdash;bon soir&mdash;et bonne
nuit</i>&mdash;"</p>
<p>And, too low for him to hear even the faintest breathing whisper
of her voice&mdash;"Good-night. I love you with all my
heart&mdash;with all my heart&mdash;in my own fashion."</p>
<hr style='width: 45%;' />
<p>He had been asleep an hour, perhaps more, when something
awakened him, and he found himself sitting bolt upright in bed,
dawn already whitening his windows.</p>
<p>Somebody was knocking. He swung out of bed, stepped into his
bath-slippers, and, passing swiftly to the door, opened it. Gerald
stood there, fully dressed.</p>
<p>"I'm going to town on the early train," began the boy&mdash;"I
thought I'd tell you&mdash;"</p>
<p>"Nonsense! Gerald, go back to bed!"</p>
<p>"I can't sleep, Philip&mdash;"</p>
<p>"Can't sleep? Oh, that's the trouble, is it? Well, then, sit
here and talk to me." He gave a mighty yawn&mdash;"I'm not sleepy,
either; I can go days without it. Here!&mdash;here's a comfortable
chair to sprawl in. . . . It's daylight already; doesn't the
morning air smell sweet? I've a jug of milk and some grapes and
peaches in my ice-cupboard if you feel inclined. No? All right;
stretch out, sight for a thousand yards, and fire at will."</p>
<p>Gerald strove to smile; for a while he lay loosely in the
arm-chair, his listless eyes intent on the strange, dim light which
fell across the waste of sea fog. Only the water along the shore's
edge remained visible; all else was a blank wall behind which,
stretching to the horizon, lay the unseen ocean. Already a few
restless gulls were on the wing, sheering inland; and their
raucous, treble cries accented the pallid stillness.</p>
<p>But the dawn was no paler than the boy's face&mdash;no more
desolate. Trouble was his, the same old trouble that has dogged the
trail of folly since time began; and Selwyn knew it and waited.</p>
<p>At last the boy broke out: "This is a cowardly trick&mdash;this
slinking in to you with all my troubles after what you've done for
me&mdash;after the rotten way I've treated you&mdash;"</p>
<p>"Look here, my boy!" said Selwyn coolly, crossing one knee over
the other and dropping both hands into the pockets of his
pajamas&mdash;"I asked you to come to me, didn't I? Well, then;
don't criticise my judgment in doing it. It isn't likely I'd ask
you to do a cowardly thing."</p>
<p>"You don't understand what a wretched scrape I'm in&mdash;"</p>
<p>"I don't yet; but you're going to tell me&mdash;"</p>
<p>"Philip, I can't&mdash;I simply cannot. It's so
contemptible&mdash;and you warned me&mdash;and I owe you already so
much&mdash;"</p>
<p>"You owe me a little money," observed Selwyn with a careless
smile, "and you've a lifetime to pay it in. What is the trouble
now; do you need more? I haven't an awful lot, old
fellow&mdash;worse luck!&mdash;but what I have is at your
call&mdash;as you know perfectly well. Is that all that is worrying
you?"</p>
<p>"No&mdash;not all. I&mdash;Neergard has lent me money&mdash;done
things&mdash;placed me under obligations. . . . I liked him, you
know; I trusted him. . . . People he desired to know I made him
known to. He was a&mdash;a trifle peremptory at times&mdash;as
though my obligations to him left me no choice but to take him to
such people as he desired to meet. . . . We&mdash;we had
trouble&mdash;recently."</p>
<p>"What sort?"</p>
<p>"Personal. I felt&mdash;began to feel&mdash;the pressure on me.
There was, at moments, something almost of menace in his requests
and suggestions&mdash;an importunity I did not exactly understand.
. . . And then he said something to me&mdash;"</p>
<p>"Go on; what?"</p>
<p>"He'd been hinting at it before; and even when I found him
jolliest and most amusing and companionable I never thought of him
as a&mdash;a social possibility&mdash;I mean among those who really
count&mdash;like my own people&mdash;"</p>
<p>"Oh! he asked you to introduce him into your own family
circle?"</p>
<p>"Yes&mdash;I didn't understand it at first&mdash;until somehow I
began to feel the pressure of it&mdash;the vague but constant
importunity. . . . He was a good fellow&mdash;at least I thought
so; I hated to hurt him&mdash;to assume any attitude that might
wound him. But, good heavens!&mdash;he couldn't seem to understand
that nobody in our family would receive him&mdash;although he had a
certain footing with the Fanes and Harmons and a few
others&mdash;like the Siowitha people&mdash;or at least the men of
those families. Don't you see, Philip?"</p>
<p>"Yes, my boy, I see. Go on! When did he ask to be presented
to&mdash;your sister?"</p>
<p>"W-who told you that?" asked the boy with an angry flush.</p>
<p>"You did&mdash;almost. You were going to, anyway. So that was
it, was it? That was when you realised a few
things&mdash;understood one or two things; was it not? . . . And
how did you reply? Arrogantly, I suppose."</p>
<p>"Yes."</p>
<p>"With&mdash;a&mdash;some little show
of&mdash;a&mdash;contempt?"</p>
<p>"Yes, I suppose so."</p>
<p>"Exactly. And Neergard&mdash;was put out&mdash;slightly?"</p>
<p>"Yes," said the boy, losing some of his colour. "I&mdash;a
moment afterward I was sorry I had spoken so plainly; but I need
not have been. . . . He was very ugly about it."</p>
<p>"Threats of calling loans?" asked Selwyn, smiling.</p>
<p>"Hints; not exactly threats. I was in a bad way, too&mdash;" The
boy winced and swallowed hard; then, with sudden white desperation
stamped on his drawn face: "Oh, Philip&mdash;it&mdash;it is
disgraceful enough&mdash;but how am I going to tell you the
rest?&mdash;how can I speak of this matter to you&mdash;"</p>
<p>"What matter?"</p>
<p>"A&mdash;about&mdash;about Mrs. Ruthven&mdash;"</p>
<p>"<i>What</i> matter?" repeated Selwyn. His voice rang a little,
but the colour had fled from his face.</p>
<p>"She was&mdash;Jack Ruthven charged her with&mdash;and
me&mdash;charged me with&mdash;"</p>
<p>"<i>You</i>!"</p>
<p>"Yes."</p>
<p>"Well&mdash;it was a lie, wasn't it?" Selwyn's ashy lips
scarcely moved, but his eyes were narrowing to a glimmer. "It was a
lie, wasn't it?" he repeated.</p>
<p>"Yes&mdash;a lie. I'd say it, anyway, you understand&mdash;but
it really was a lie."</p>
<p>Selwyn quietly leaned back in his chair; a little colour
returned to his cheeks.</p>
<p>"All right&mdash;old fellow"&mdash;his voice scarcely
quivered&mdash;"all right; go on. I knew, of course, that Ruthven
lied, but it was part of the story to hear you say so. Go on. What
did Ruthven do?"</p>
<p>"There has been a separation," said the boy in a low voice. "He
behaved like a dirty cad&mdash;she had no resources&mdash;no means
of support&mdash;" He hesitated, moistening his dry lips with his
tongue. "Mrs. Ruthven has been very, very kind to me. I was&mdash;I
am fond of her; oh, I know well enough I never had any business to
meet her; I behaved abominably toward you&mdash;and the family. But
it was done; I knew her, and liked her tremendously. She was the
only one who was decent to me&mdash;who tried to keep me from
acting like a fool about cards&mdash;"</p>
<p><i>Did</i> she try?"</p>
<p>"Yes&mdash;indeed, yes! . . . and, Phil&mdash;she&mdash;I don't
know how to say it&mdash;but she&mdash;when she spoke of&mdash;of
you&mdash;begged me to try to be like you. . . . And it is a lie
what people say about her!&mdash;what gossip says. I know; I have
known her so well&mdash;and&mdash;I was like other
men&mdash;charmed and fascinated by her; but the women of that set
are a pack of cats, and the men&mdash;well, none of them ever
ventured to say anything to me! . . . And that is all, Philip. I
was horribly in debt to Neergard; then Ruthven turned on
me&mdash;and on her; and I borrowed more from Neergard and went to
her bank and deposited it to the credit of her account&mdash;but
she doesn't know it was from me&mdash;she supposes Jack Ruthven did
it out of ordinary decency, for she said so to me. And that is how
matters stand; Neergard is ugly, and grows more threatening about
those loans&mdash;and I haven't any money, and Mrs. Ruthven will
require more very soon&mdash;"</p>
<p>"Is that <i>all</i>?" demanded Selwyn sharply.</p>
<p>"Yes&mdash;all. . . . I know I have behaved
shamefully&mdash;"</p>
<p>"I've seen," observed Selwyn in a dry, hard voice, "worse
behaviour than yours. . . . Have you a pencil, Gerald? Get a sheet
of paper from that desk. Now, write out a list of the loans made
you by Neergard. . . . Every cent, if you please. . . . And the
exact amount you placed to Mrs. Ruthven's credit. . . . Have you
written that? Let me see it."</p>
<p>The boy handed him the paper. He studied it without the
slightest change of expression&mdash;knowing all the while what it
meant to him; knowing that this burden must be assumed by himself
because Austin would never assume it.</p>
<p>And he sat there staring at space over the top of the pencilled
sheet of paper, striving to find some help in the matter. But he
knew Austin; he knew what would happen to Gerald if, after the late
reconciliation with his ex-guardian, he came once more to him with
such a confession of debt and disgrace.</p>
<p>No; Austin must be left out; there were three things to do: One
of them was to pay Neergard; another to sever Gerald's connection
with him for ever; and the third thing to be done was something
which did not concern Gerald or Austin&mdash;perhaps, not even
Ruthven. It was to be done, no matter what the cost. But the
thought of the cost sent a shiver over him, and left his careworn
face gray.</p>
<p>His head sank; he fixed his narrowing eyes on the floor and held
them there, silent, unmoved, while within the tempests of terror,
temptation, and doubt assailed him, dragging at the soul of him,
where it clung blindly to its anchorage. And it held
fast&mdash;raging, despairing in the bitterness of renunciation,
but still held on through the most dreadful tempest that ever swept
him. Courage, duty, reparation&mdash;the words drummed in his
brain, stupefying him with their dull clamour; but he understood
and listened, knowing the end&mdash;knowing that the end must
always be the same for him. It was the revolt of instinct against
drilled and ingrained training, inherited and re-schooled&mdash;the
insurgent clamour of desire opposed to that stern self-repression
characteristic of generations of Selwyns, who had held duty
important enough to follow, even when their bodies died in its
wake.</p>
<p>And it were easier for him, perhaps, if his body died.</p>
<p>He rose and walked to the window. Over the Bay of Shoals the fog
was lifting; and he saw the long gray pier jutting
northward&mdash;the pier where the troopships landed their dead and
dying when the Spanish war was ended.</p>
<p>And he looked at the hill where the field hospital had once
been. His brother died there&mdash;in the wake of that same duty
which no Selwyn could ignore.</p>
<p>After a moment he turned to Gerald, a smile on his colourless
face:</p>
<p>"It will be all right, my boy. You are not to worry&mdash;do you
understand me? Go to bed, now; you need the sleep. Go to bed, I
tell you&mdash;I'll stand by you. You must begin all over again,
Gerald&mdash;and so must I; and so must I."</p>

<h3>LEX NON SCRIPTA</h3>
<p>Selwyn had gone to New York with Gerald, "for a few days," as he
expressed it; but it was now the first week in October, and he had
not yet returned to Silverside.</p>
<p>A brief note to Nina thanking her for having had him at
Silverside, and speaking vaguely of some business matters which
might detain him indefinitely&mdash;a briefer note to Eileen
regretting his inability to return for the present&mdash;were all
the communication they had from him except news brought by Austin,
who came down from town every Friday.</p>
<p>A long letter to him from Nina still remained unanswered; Austin
had seen him only once in town; Lansing, now back in New York,
wrote a postscript in a letter to Drina, asking for Selwyn's new
address&mdash;the first intimation anybody had that he had given up
his lodgings on Lexington Avenue.</p>
<p>"I was perfectly astonished to find he had gone, leaving no
address," wrote Boots; "and nobody knows anything about him at his
clubs. I have an idea that he may have gone to Washington to see
about the Chaosite affair; but if you have any address except his
clubs, please send it to me."</p>
<p>Eileen had not written him; his sudden leave-taking nearly a
month ago had so astounded her that she could not believe he meant
to be gone more than a day or two. Then came his note, written at
the Patroons' Club&mdash;very brief, curiously stilted and formal,
with a strange tone of finality through it, as though he were
taking perfunctory leave of people who had come temporarily into
his life, and as though the chances were agreeably even of his ever
seeing them again.</p>
<p>The girl was not hurt, as yet; she remained merely confused,
incredulous, unreconciled. That there was to be some further
explanation of his silence she never dreamed of doubting; and there
seemed to be nothing to do in the interval but await it. As for
writing him, some instinct forbade it, even when Nina suggested
that she write, adding laughingly that nothing else seemed likely
to stir her brother.</p>
<p>For the first few days the children clamoured intermittently for
him; but children forget, and Billy continued to cast out his pack
in undying hope of a fox or bunny, and the younger children brought
their butterfly-nets and sand-shovels to Austin and Nina for
repairs; and Drina, when Boots deserted her for his Air Line
Company, struck up a wholesome and lively friendship with a dozen
subfreshmen and the younger Orchil girls, and began to play golf
like a little fiend.</p>
<p>It was possible, now, to ride cross-country; and Nina, who was
always in terror of an added ounce to her perfect figure, rode
every day with Eileen; and Austin, on a big hunter, joined them two
days in the week.</p>
<p>There were dances, too, and Nina went to some of them. So did
Eileen, who had created a furor among the younger brothers and
undergraduates; and the girl was busy enough with sailing and
motoring and dashing through the Sound in all sorts of power
boats.</p>
<p>Once, under Austin's and young Craig's supervision, she tried
shore-bird shooting; but the first broken wing from the gun on her
left settled the thing for ever for her, and the horror of the
blood-sprinkled, kicking mass of feathers haunted her dreams for a
week.</p>
<p>Youths, however, continued to hover numerously about her. They
sat in soulful rows upon the veranda at Silverside; they played
guitars at her in canoes, accompanying the stringy thrumming with
the peculiarly exasperating vocal noises made only by very young
undergraduates; they rode with her and Nina; they pervaded her
vicinity with a tireless constancy amounting to obsession.</p>
<p>She liked it well enough; she was as interested in everything as
usual; as active at the nets, playing superbly, and with all her
heart in the game&mdash;while it lasted; she swung her slim brassy
with all the old-time fire and satisfaction in the clean, sharp
whack, as the ball flew through the sunshine, rising beautifully in
a long, low trajectory against the velvet fair-green.</p>
<p>It was unalloyed happiness for her to sit her saddle, feeling
under her the grand stride of her powerful hunter on a headlong
cross-country gallop; it was purest pleasure for her to lean
forward in her oilskins, her eyes almost blinded with salt spray,
while the low motor-boat rushed on and on through cataracts of
foam, and the heaving, green sea-miles fled away, away, in the
hissing furrow of the wake.</p>
<p>Truly, for her, the world was still green, the sun bright, the
high sky blue; but she had not forgotten that the earth had been
greener, the sun brighter, the azure above her more
splendid&mdash;once upon a time&mdash;like the first phrase of a
tale that is told. And if she were at times listless, absent-eyed,
subdued&mdash;a trifle graver, or unusually silent, seeking the
still paths of the garden as though in need of youthful meditation
and the quiet of the sunset hour, she never doubted that that tale
would be retold for her again. Only&mdash;alas!&mdash;the fair days
were passing, and the russet rustle of October sounded already
among the curling leaves in the garden; and he had been away a long
time&mdash;a very long time. And she could not understand.</p>
<p>On one of Austin's week-end visits, the hour for conjugal confab
having arrived and husband and wife locked in the seclusion of
their bedroom&mdash;being old-fashioned enough to occupy the
same&mdash;he said, with a trace of irritation in his voice:</p>
<p>"I don't know where Phil is, or what he's about. I'm
wondering&mdash;he's got the Selwyn conscience, you know&mdash;what
he's up to&mdash;and if it's any kind of dam-foolishness. Haven't
you heard a word from him, Nina?"</p>
<p>Nina, in her pretty night attire, had emerged from her
dressing-room, locked out Kit-Ki and her maid, and had curled up in
a big, soft armchair, cradling her bare ankles in her hand.</p>
<p>"I haven't heard from him," she said. "Rosamund saw him in
Washington&mdash;passed him on the street. He was looking horridly
thin and worn, she wrote. He did not see her."</p>
<p>"Now what in the name of common sense is he doing in
Washington!" exclaimed Austin wrathfully. "Probably breaking his
heart because nobody cares to examine his Chaosite. I told him, as
long as he insisted on bothering the Government with it instead of
making a deal with the Lawn people, that I'd furnish him with a key
to the lobby. I told him I knew the right people, could get him the
right lawyers, and start the thing properly. Why didn't he come to
me about it? There's only one way to push such things, and he's as
ignorant of it as a boatswain in the marine cavalry."</p>
<p>Nina said thoughtfully: "You always were impatient of people,
dear. Perhaps Phil may get them to try his Chaosite without any
wire-pulling. . . . I do wish he'd write. I can't understand his
continued silence. Hasn't Boots heard from him? Hasn't Gerald?"</p>
<p>"Not a word. And by the way, Nina, Gerald has done rather an
unexpected thing. I saw him last night; he came to the house and
told me that he had just severed his connection with Julius
Neergard's company."</p>
<p>"I'm glad of it!" exclaimed Nina; "I'm glad he showed the good
sense to do it!"</p>
<p>"Well&mdash;yes. As a matter of fact, Neergard is going to be a
very rich man some day; and Gerald might have&mdash;But I am not
displeased. What appeals to me is the spectacle of the boy acting
with conviction on his own initiative. Whether or not he is making
a mistake has nothing to do with the main thing, and that is that
Gerald, for the first time in his rather colourless career, seems
to have developed the rudiments of a backbone out of the tail which
I saw so frequently either flourishing defiance at me or tucked
sullenly between his hind legs. I had quite a talk with him last
night; he behaved very decently, and with a certain modesty which
may, one day, develop into something approaching dignity. We spoke
of his own affairs&mdash;in which, for the first time, he appeared
to take an intelligent interest. Besides that, he seemed willing
enough to ask my judgment in several matters&mdash;a radical
departure from his cub days."</p>
<p>"What are you going to do for him, dear?" asked his wife, rather
bewildered at the unexpected news. "Of course he must go into some
sort of business again&mdash;"</p>
<p>"Certainly. And, to my astonishment, he actually came and
solicited my advice. I&mdash;I was so amazed, Nina, that I could
scarcely credit my own senses. I managed to say that I'd think it
over. Of course he can, if he chooses, begin everything again and
come in with me. Or&mdash;if I am satisfied that he has any
ability&mdash;he can set up some sort of a real-estate office on
his own hook. I could throw a certain amount of business in his
way&mdash;but it's all in the air, yet. I'll see him Monday, and
we'll have another talk. By gad! Nina," he added, with a flush of
half-shy satisfaction on his ruddy face, "it's&mdash;it's almost
like having a grown-up son coming bothering me with his affairs;
ah&mdash;rather agreeable than otherwise. There's certainly
something in that boy. I&mdash;perhaps I have been, at moments, a
trifle impatient. But I did not mean to be. You know that, dear,
don't you?"</p>
<p>His wife looked up at her big husband in quiet amusement. "Oh,
yes! I know a little about you," she said, "and a little about
Gerald, too. He is only a masculine edition of Eileen&mdash;the
irresponsible freedom of life brought out all his faults at once,
like a horrid rash; it's due to the masculine notion of masculine
education. His sister's education was essentially the contrary:
humours were eradicated before first symptoms became manifest. The
moral, mental, and physical drilling and schooling was undertaken
and accepted without the slightest hope&mdash;and later without the
slightest desire&mdash;for any relaxation of the rigour when she
became of age and mistress of herself. That's the difference: a boy
looks forward to the moment when he can flourish his heels and wag
his ears and bray; a girl has no such prospect. Gerald has brayed;
Eileen never will flourish her heels unless she becomes fashionable
after marriage&mdash;which isn't very likely&mdash;"</p>
<p>Nina hesitated, another idea intruding.</p>
<p>"By the way, Austin; the Orchil boy&mdash;the one in
Harvard&mdash;proposed to Eileen&mdash;the little idiot! She told
me&mdash;thank goodness! she still does tell me things. Also the
younger and chubbier Draymore youth has offered himself&mdash;after
a killingly proper interview with me. I thought it might amuse you
to hear of it."</p>
<p>"It might amuse me more if Eileen would get busy and bring
Philip into camp," observed her husband. "And why the devil they
don't make up their minds to it is beyond me. That brother of yours
is the limit sometimes. I'm fond of him&mdash;you know it&mdash;but
he certainly can be the limit sometimes."</p>
<p>"Do you know," said Nina, "that I believe he is in love with
her?"</p>
<p>"Then, why doesn't&mdash;"</p>
<p>"I don't know. I was sure&mdash;I am sure now&mdash;that the
girl cares more for him than for anybody. And yet&mdash;and yet I
don't believe she is actually in love with him. Several times I
supposed she was&mdash;or near it, anyway. . . . But they are a
curious pair, Austin&mdash;so quaint about it; so slow and
old-fashioned. . . . And the child is the most innocent
being&mdash;in some ways. . . . Which is all right unless she
becomes one of those pokey, earnest, knowledge-absorbing young
things with the very germ of vitality dried up and withered in her
before she awakens. . . . I don't know&mdash;I really don't. For a
girl <i>must</i> have something of the human about her to attract a
man, and be attracted. . . . Not that she need know anything about
love&mdash;or even suspect it. But there must be some response in
her, some&mdash;some&mdash;"</p>
<p>"Deviltry?" suggested Austin.</p>
<p>His pretty wife laughed and dropped one knee over the other,
leaning back to watch him finish his good-night cigarette. After a
moment her face grew grave, and she bent forward.</p>
<p>"Speaking of Rosamund a moment ago reminds me of something else
she wrote&mdash;it's about Alixe. Have you heard anything?"</p>
<p>"Not a word," said Austin, with a frank scowl, "and don't want
to."</p>
<p>"It's only this&mdash;that Alixe is ill. Nobody seems to know
what the matter is; nobody has seen her. But she's at Clifton, with
a couple of nurses, and Rosamund heard rumours that she is very ill
indeed. . . . People go to Clifton for shattered nerves, you
know."</p>
<p>"Yes; for bridge-fidgets, neurosis, pip, and the various jumps
that originate in the simpler social circles. What's the particular
matter with her? Too many cocktails? Or a dearth of grand
slams?"</p>
<p>"You are brutal, Austin. Besides, I don't know. She's had a
perfectly dreary life with her husband. . . . I&mdash;I can't
forget how fond I was of her in spite of what she did to Phil. . .
. Besides, I'm beginning to be certain that it was not entirely her
fault."</p>
<p>"What? Do you think Phil&mdash;"</p>
<p>"No, no, no! Don't be an utter idiot. All I mean to say is that
Alixe was always nervous and high-strung; odd at times;
eccentric&mdash;<i>more</i> than merely eccentric&mdash;"</p>
<p>"You mean dippy?"</p>
<p>"Oh, Austin, you're horrid. I mean that there is mental trouble
in that family. You have heard of it as well as I; you know her
father died of it&mdash;"</p>
<p>"The usual defence in criminal cases," observed Austin, flicking
his cigarette-end into the grate. "I'm sorry, dear, that Alixe has
the jumps; hope she'll get over 'em. But as for pretending I've any
use for her, I can't and don't and won't. She spoiled life for the
best man I know; she kicked his reputation into a cocked hat, and
he, with his chivalrous Selwyn conscience, let her do it. I did
like her once; I don't like her now, and that's natural and it
winds up the matter. Dear friend, shall we, perhaps, to bed
presently our way wend&mdash;yess?"</p>
<p>"Yes, dear; but you are not very charitable about Alixe. And I
tell you I've my own ideas about her illness&mdash;especially as
she is at Clifton. . . . I wonder where her little beast of a
husband is?"</p>
<p>But Austin only yawned and looked at the toes of his slippers,
and then longingly at the pillows.</p>
<hr style='width: 45%;' />
<p>Had Nina known it, the husband of Mrs. Ruthven, whom she had
characterised so vividly, was at that very moment seated in a
private card-room at the Stuyvesant Club with Sanxon Orchil, George
Fane, and Bradley Harmon; and the game had been bridge, as usual,
and had gone very heavily against him.</p>
<p>Several things had gone against Mr. Ruthven recently; for one
thing, he was beginning to realise that he had made a vast mistake
in mixing himself up in any transactions with Neergard.</p>
<p>When he, at Neergard's cynical suggestion, had consented to
exploit his own club&mdash;the Siowitha&mdash;and had consented to
resign from it to do so, he had every reason to believe that
Neergard meant to either mulct them heavily or buy them out. In
either case, having been useful to Neergard, his profits from the
transaction would have been considerable.</p>
<p>But, even while he was absorbed in figuring them up&mdash;and he
needed the money, as usual&mdash;Neergard coolly informed him of
his election to the club, and Ruthven, thunder-struck, began to
perceive the depth of the underground mole tunnels which Neergard
had dug to undermine and capture the stronghold which had now
surrendered to him.</p>
<p>Rage made him ill for a week; but there was nothing to do about
it. He had been treacherous to his club and to his own caste, and
Neergard knew it&mdash;and knew perfectly well that Ruthven dared
not protest&mdash;dared not even whimper.</p>
<p>Then Neergard began to use Ruthven when he needed him; and he
began to permit himself to win at cards in Ruthven's house&mdash;a
thing he had not dared to do before. He also permitted himself more
ease and freedom in that house&mdash;a sort of intimacy <i>sans
fa&ccedil;on</i>&mdash;even a certain jocularity. He also gave
himself the privilege of inviting the Ruthvens on board the
<i>Niobrara</i>; and Ruthven went, furious at being forced to stamp
with his open approval an episode which made Neergard a social
probability.</p>
<p>How it happened that Rosamund divined something of the situation
is not quite clear; but she always had a delicate nose for anything
not intended for her, and the thing amused her immensely,
particularly because what viciousness had been so long suppressed
in Neergard was now tentatively making itself apparent in his
leering ease among women he so recently feared.</p>
<p>This, also, was gall and wormwood to Ruthven, so long the
official lap-dog of the very small set he kennelled with; and the
women of that set were perverse enough to find Neergard amusing,
and his fertility in contriving new extravagances for them
interested these people, whose only interest had always been
centred in themselves.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Neergard had almost finished with Gerald&mdash;he had
only one further use for him; and as his social success became more
pronounced with the people he had crowded in among, he became
bolder and more insolent, no longer at pains to mole-tunnel toward
the object desired, no longer overcareful about his mask. And one
day he asked the boy very plainly why he had never invited him to
meet his sister. And he got an answer that he never forgot.</p>
<p>And all the while Ruthven squirmed under the light but steadily
inflexible pressure of the curb which Neergard had slipped on him
so deftly; he had viewed with indifference Gerald's boyish devotion
to his wife, which was even too open and na&iuml;ve to be of
interest to those who witnessed it. But he had not counted on
Neergard's sudden hatred of Gerald; and the first token of that
hatred fell upon the boy like a thunderbolt when Neergard whispered
to Ruthven, one night at the Stuyvesant Club, and Ruthven,
exasperated, had gone straight home, to find his wife in tears, and
the boy clumsily attempting to comfort her, both her hands in
his.</p>
<p>"Perhaps," said Ruthven coldly, "you have some plausible
explanation for this sort of thing. If you haven't, you'd better
trump up one together, and I'll send you my attorney to hear it. In
that event," he added, "you'd better leave your joint address when
you find a more convenient house than mine."</p>
<p>As a matter of fact, he had really meant nothing more than the
threat and the insult, the situation permitting him a heavier hold
upon his wife and a new grip on Gerald in case he ever needed him;
but threat and insult were very real to the boy, and he knocked Mr.
Ruthven flat on his back&mdash;the one thing required to change
that gentleman's pretence to deadly earnest.</p>
<p>Ruthven scrambled to his feet; Gerald did it again; and, after
that, Mr. Ruthven prudently remained prone during the delivery of a
terse but concise opinion of him expressed by Gerald.</p>
<p>After Gerald had gone, Ruthven opened first one eye, then the
other, then his mouth, and finally sat up; and his wife, who had
been curiously observing him, smiled.</p>
<p>"It is strange," she said serenely, "that I never thought of
that method. I wonder why I never thought of it," lazily stretching
her firm young arms and glancing casually at their symmetry and
smooth-skinned strength. "Go into your own quarters," she added, as
he rose, shaking with fury: "I've endured the last brutality I
shall ever suffer from you."</p>
<p>She dropped her folded hands into her lap, gazing coolly at him;
but there was a glitter in her eyes which arrested his first step
toward her.</p>
<p>"I think," she said, "that you mean my ruin. Well, we began it
long ago, and I doubt if I have anything of infamy to learn, thanks
to my thorough schooling as your wife. . . . But knowledge is not
necessarily practice, and it happens that I have not cared to
commit the particular indiscretion so fashionable among the friends
you have surrounded me with. I merely mention this for your
information, not because I am particularly proud of it. It is not
anything to be proud of, in my case&mdash;it merely happened so; a
matter, perhaps of personal taste, perhaps because of lack of
opportunity; and there is a remote possibility that belated loyalty
to a friend I once betrayed may have kept me personally chaste in
this rotting circus circle you have driven me around in, harnessed
to your vicious caprice, dragging the weight of your
corruption&mdash;"</p>
<p>She laughed. "I had no idea that I could be so eloquent, Jack.
But my mind has become curiously clear during the last
year&mdash;strangely and unusually limpid and precise. Why, my poor
friend, every plot of yours and of your friends&mdash;every
underhand attempt to discredit and injure me has been perfectly
apparent to me. You supposed that my headaches, my outbursts of
anger, my wretched nights, passed in tears&mdash;and the long, long
days spent kneeling in the ashes of dead memories&mdash;all these
you supposed had weakened&mdash;perhaps unsettled&mdash;my mind. .
. . You lie if you deny it, for you have had doctors watching me
for months. . . . You didn't know I was aware of it, did you? But I
was, and I am. . . . And you told them that my father died
of&mdash;of brain trouble, you coward!"</p>
<p>Still he stood there, jaw loose, gazing at her as though
fascinated; and she smiled and settled deeper in her chair, framing
the gilded foliations of the back with her beautiful arms.</p>
<p>"We might as well understand one another now," she said
languidly. "If you mean to get rid of me, there is no use in
attempting to couple my name with that of any man; first, because
it is untrue, and you not only know it, but you know you can't
prove it. There remains the cowardly method you have been nerving
yourself to attempt, never dreaming that I was aware of your
purpose."</p>
<p>A soft, triumphant little laugh escaped her. There was something
almost childish in her delight at outwitting him, and, very slowly,
into his worn and faded eyes a new expression began to
dawn&mdash;the flickering stare of suspicion. And in it the purely
personal impression of rage and necessity of vengeance subsided; he
eyed her intently, curiously, and with a cool persistence which
finally began to irritate her.</p>
<p>"What a credulous fool you are," she said, "to build your hopes
of a separation on any possible mental disability of mine."</p>
<p>He stood a moment without answering, then quietly seated
himself. The suspicious glimmer in his faded eyes had become the
concentration of a curiosity almost apprehensive.</p>
<p>"Go on," he said; "what else?"</p>
<p>"What do you mean?"</p>
<p>"You have been saying several things&mdash;about doctors whom I
have set to watch you&mdash;for a year or more."</p>
<p>"Do you deny it?" she retorted angrily.</p>
<p>"No&mdash;no, I do not deny anything. But&mdash;who are these
doctors&mdash;whom you have noticed?"</p>
<p>"I don't know who they are," she replied impatiently. "I've seen
them often enough&mdash;following me on the street, or in public
places&mdash;watching me. They are everywhere&mdash;you have them
well paid, evidently; I suppose you can afford it. But you are
wasting your time."</p>
<p>"You think so?"</p>
<p>"Yes!" she cried in a sudden violence that startled him, "you
are wasting your time! And so am I&mdash;talking to
you&mdash;enduring your personal affronts and brutal sneers.
Sufficient for you that I know my enemies, and that I am saner,
thank God, than any of them!" She flashed a look of sudden fury at
him, and rose from her chair. He also rose with a promptness that
bordered on precipitation.</p>
<p>"For the remainder of the spring and summer," she said, "I shall
make my plans regardless of you. I shall not go to Newport; you are
at liberty to use the house there as you choose. And as for this
incident with Gerald, you had better not pursue it any further. Do
you understand?"</p>
<p>He nodded, dropping his hands into his coat-pockets.</p>
<p>"Now you may go," she said coolly.</p>
<p>He went&mdash;not, however, to his room, but straight to the
house of the fashionable physician who ministered to wealth with an
unction and success that had permitted him, in summer time, to
occupy his own villa at Newport and dispense further ministrations
when requested.</p>
<hr style='width: 45%;' />
<p>On the night of the conjugal conference between Nina Gerard and
her husband&mdash;and almost at the same hour&mdash;Jack Ruthven,
hard hit in the card-room of the Stuyvesant Club, sat huddled over
the table, figuring up what sort of checks he was to draw to the
credit of George Fane and Sanxon Orchil.</p>
<p>Matters had been going steadily against him for some
time&mdash;almost everything, in fact, except the opinions of
several physicians in a matter concerning his wife. For, in that
scene between them in early spring, his wife had put that into his
head which had never before been there&mdash;suspicion of her
mental soundness.</p>
<p>And now, as he sat there, pencil in hand, adding up the
score-cards, he remembered that he was to interview his attorney
that evening at his own house&mdash;a late appointment, but
necessary to insure the presence of one or two physicians at a
consultation to definitely decide what course of action might be
taken.</p>
<p>He had not laid eyes on his wife that summer, but for the first
time he had really had her watched during her absence. What she
lived on&mdash;how she managed&mdash;he had not the least idea, and
less concern. All he knew was that he had contributed nothing, and
he was quite certain that her balance at her own bank had been
nonexistent for months.</p>
<p>But any possible additional grounds for putting her away from
him that might arise in a question as to her sources of support no
longer interested him. That line of attack was unnecessary;
besides, he had no suspicion concerning her personal chastity. But
Alixe, that evening in early spring, had unwittingly suggested to
him the use of a weapon the existence of which he had never dreamed
of. And he no longer entertained any doubts of its efficiency as a
means of finally ridding him of a wife whom he had never been able
to fully subdue or wholly corrupt, and who, as a mate for him in
his schemes for the pecuniary maintenance of his household, had
proven useless and almost ruinous.</p>
<p>He had not seen her during the summer. In the autumn he had
heard of her conduct at Hitherwood House. And, a week later, to his
astonishment, he learned of her serious illness, and that she had
been taken to Clifton. It was the only satisfactory news he had had
of her in months.</p>
<p>So now he sat there at the bridge-table in the private card-room
of the Stuyvesant Club, deftly adding up the score that had gone
against him, but consoled somewhat at the remembrance of his
appointment, and of the probability of an early release from the
woman who had been to him only a source of social mistakes,
domestic unhappiness, and financial disappointment.</p>
<p>When he had finished his figuring he fished out a check-book,
detached a tiny gold fountain-pen from the bunch of seals and
knick-knacks on his watch-chain, and, filling in the checks, passed
them over without comment.</p>
<p>Fane rose, stretching his long neck, gazed about through his
spectacles, like a benevolent saurian, and finally fixed his mild,
protruding eyes upon Orchil.</p>
<p>"There'll be a small game at the Fountain Club," he said, with a
grin which creased his cheeks until his retreating chin almost
disappeared under the thick lower lip.</p>
<p>Orchil twiddled his long, crinkly, pointed moustache and glanced
interrogatively at Harmon; then he yawned, stretched his arms, and
rose, pocketing the check, which Ruthven passed to him, with a
careless nod of thanks.</p>
<p>As they filed out of the card-room into the dim passageway,
Orchil leading, a tall, shadowy figure in evening dress stepped
back from the door of the card-room against the wall to give them
right of way, and Orchil, peering at him without recognition in the
dull light, bowed suavely as he passed, as did Fane, craning his
curved neck, and Harmon also, who followed in his wake.</p>
<p>But when Ruthven came abreast of the figure in the passage and
bowed his way past, a low voice from the courteous unknown,
pronouncing his name, halted him short.</p>
<p>"I want a word with you, Mr. Ruthven," added Selwyn; "that
card-room will suit me, if you please."</p>
<p>But Ruthven, recovering from the shock of Selwyn's voice,
started to pass him without a word.</p>
<p>"I said that I wanted to speak to you!" repeated Selwyn.</p>
<p>Ruthven, deigning no reply, attempted to shove by him; and
Selwyn, placing one hand flat against the other's shoulder, pushed
him violently back into the card-room he had just left, and,
stepping in behind him, closed and locked the door.</p>
<p>"W-what the devil do you mean!" gasped Ruthven, his hard,
minutely shaven face turning a deep red.</p>
<p>"What I say," replied Selwyn; "that I want a word or two with
you."</p>
<p>He stood still for a moment, in the centre of the little room,
tall, gaunt of feature, and very pale. The close, smoky atmosphere
of the place evidently annoyed him; he glanced about at the
scattered cards, the empty oval bottles in their silver stands, the
half-burned remains of cigars on the green-topped table. Then he
stepped over and opened the only window.</p>
<p>"Sit down," he said, turning on Ruthven; and he seated himself
and crossed one leg over the other. Ruthven remained standing.</p>
<p>"This&mdash;this thing," began Ruthven in a voice made husky and
indistinct through fury, "this ruffianly behaviour amounts to
assault."</p>
<p>"As you choose," nodded Selwyn, almost listlessly, "but be
quiet; I've something to think of besides your convenience."</p>
<p>For a few moments he sat silent, thoughtful, narrowing eyes
considering the patterns on the rug at his feet; and Ruthven, weak
with rage and apprehension, was forced to stand there awaiting the
pleasure of a man of whom he had suddenly become horribly
afraid.</p>
<p>And at last Selwyn, emerging from his pallid reverie,
straightened out, shaking his broad shoulders as though to free him
of that black spectre perching there.</p>
<p>"Ruthven," he said, "a few years ago you persuaded my wife to
leave me; and I have never punished you. There were two reasons why
I did not: the first was because I did not wish to punish her, and
any blow at you would have reached her heavily. The second reason,
subordinate to the first, is obvious: decent men, in these days,
have tacitly agreed to suspend a violent appeal to the unwritten
law as a concession to civilisation. This second reason, however,
depends entirely upon the first, as you see."</p>
<p>He leaned back in his chair thoughtfully, and recrossed his
legs.</p>
<p>"I did not ask you into this room," he said, with a slight
smile, "to complain of the wrong you have committed against me, or
to retail to you the consequences of your act as they may or may
not have affected me and my career; I have&mdash;ah&mdash;invited
you here to explain to you the present condition of your own
domestic affairs"&mdash;he looked at Ruthven full in the
face&mdash;"to explain them to you, and to lay down for you the
course of conduct which you are to follow."</p>
<p>"By God!&mdash;" began Ruthven, stepping back, one hand reaching
for the door-knob; but Selwyn's voice rang out clean and sharp:</p>
<p>"Sit down!"</p>
<p>And, as Ruthven glared at him out of his little eyes:</p>
<p>"You'd better sit down, I think," said Selwyn softly.</p>
<p>Ruthven turned, took two unsteady steps forward, and laid his
heavily ringed hand on the back of a chair. Selwyn smiled, and
Ruthven sat down.</p>
<p>"Now," continued Selwyn, "for certain rules of conduct to govern
you during the remainder of your wife's lifetime. . . . And your
wife is ill, Mr. Ruthven&mdash;sick of a sickness which may last
for a great many years, or may be terminated in as many days. Did
you know it?"</p>
<p>Ruthven snarled.</p>
<p>"Yes, of course you knew it, or you suspected it. Your wife is
in a sanitarium, as you have discovered. She is mentally
ill&mdash;rational at times&mdash;violent at moments, and for long
periods quite docile, gentle, harmless&mdash;content to be talked
to, read to, advised, persuaded. But during the last week a change
of a certain nature has occurred which&mdash;which, I am told by
competent physicians, not only renders her case beyond all hope of
ultimate recovery, but threatens an earlier termination than was at
first looked for. It is this: your wife has become like a child
again&mdash;occupied contentedly and quite happily with childish
things. She has forgotten much; her memory is quite gone. How much
she does remember it is impossible to say."</p>
<p>His head fell; his brooding eyes were fixed again on the rug at
his feet. After a while he looked up.</p>
<p>"It is pitiful, Mr. Ruthven&mdash;she is so young&mdash;with all
her physical charm and attraction quite unimpaired. But the mind is
gone&mdash;quite gone, sir. Some sudden strain&mdash;and the
tension has been great for years&mdash;some abrupt overdraft upon
her mental resource, perhaps; God knows how it came&mdash;from
sorrow, from some unkindness too long endured&mdash;"</p>
<p>Again he relapsed into his study of the rug; and slowly, warily,
Ruthven lifted his little, inflamed eyes to look at him, then
moistened his dry lips with a thick-coated tongue, and stole a
glance at the locked door.</p>
<p>"I understand," said Selwyn, looking up suddenly, "that you are
contemplating proceedings against your wife. Are you?"</p>
<p>Ruthven made no reply.</p>
<p>"<i>Are</i> you?" repeated Selwyn. His face had altered; a dim
glimmer played in his eyes like the reflection of heat lightning at
dusk.</p>
<p>"Yes, I am," said Ruthven.</p>
<p>"On the grounds of her mental incapacity?"</p>
<p>"Yes."</p>
<p>"Then, as I understand it, the woman whom you persuaded to break
every law, human and divine, for your sake, you now propose to
abandon. Is that it?"</p>
<p>Ruthven made no reply.</p>
<p>"You propose to publish her pitiable plight to the world by
beginning proceedings; you intend to notify the public of your
wife's infirmity by divorcing her."</p>
<p>"Sane or insane," burst out Ruthven, "she was riding for a
fall&mdash;and she's going to get it! What the devil are you
talking about? I'm not accountable to you. I'll do what I please;
I'll manage my own affairs&mdash;"</p>
<p>"No," said Selwyn, "I'll manage this particular affair. And now
I'll tell you how I'm going to do it. I have in my
lodgings&mdash;or rather in the small hall bedroom which I now
occupy&mdash;an army service revolver, in fairly good condition.
The cylinder was a little stiff this morning when I looked at it,
but I've oiled it with No. 27&mdash;an excellent rust solvent and
lubricant, Mr. Ruthven&mdash;and now the cylinder spins around in a
manner perfectly trustworthy. So, as I was saying, I have this very
excellent and serviceable weapon, and shall give myself the
pleasure of using it on you if you ever commence any such action
for divorce or separation against your wife. This is final."</p>
<p>Ruthven stared at him as though hypnotised.</p>
<p>"Don't mistake me," added Selwyn, a trifle wearily. "I am not
compelling you to decency for the purpose of punishing <i>you</i>;
men never trouble themselves to punish vermin&mdash;they simply
exterminate them, or they retreat and avoid them. I merely mean
that you shall never again bring publicity and shame upon your
wife&mdash;even though now, mercifully enough, she has not the
faintest idea that you are what a complacent law calls her
husband."</p>
<p>A slow blaze lighted up his eyes, and he got up from his
chair.</p>
<p>"You decadent little beast!" he said slowly, "do you suppose
that the dirty accident of your intrusion into an honest man's life
could dissolve the divine compact of wedlock? Soil it&mdash;yes;
besmirch it, render it superficially unclean, unfit,
nauseous&mdash;yes. But neither you nor your vile code nor the
imbecile law you invoked to legalise the situation really ever
deprived me of my irrevocable status and responsibility. . . .
I&mdash;even I&mdash;was once&mdash;for a while&mdash;persuaded
that it did; that the laws of the land could do this&mdash;could
free me from a faithless wife, and regularise her position in your
household. The laws of the land say so, and I&mdash;I said so at
last&mdash;persuaded because I desired to be persuaded. . . . It
was a lie. My wife, shamed or unshamed, humbled or unhumbled, true
to her marriage vows or false to them, now legally the wife of
another, has never ceased to be my wife. And it is a higher law
that corroborates me&mdash;higher than you can understand&mdash;a
law unwritten because axiomatic; a law governing the very
foundation of the social fabric, and on which that fabric is
absolutely dependent for its existence intact. But"&mdash;with a
contemptuous shrug&mdash;"you won't understand; all you can
understand is the gratification of your senses and the fear of
something interfering with that gratification&mdash;like death, for
instance. Therefore I am satisfied that you understand enough of
what I said to discontinue any legal proceedings which would tend
to discredit, expose, or cast odium on a young wife very sorely
stricken&mdash;very, very ill&mdash;whom God, in his mercy, has
blinded to the infamy where you have dragged her&mdash;under the
law of the land."</p>
<p>He turned on his heel, paced the little room once or twice, then
swung round again:</p>
<p>"Keep your filthy money&mdash;wrung from women and boys over
card-tables. Even if some blind, wormlike process of instinct
stirred the shame in you, and you ventured to offer belated aid to
the woman who bears your name, I forbid it&mdash;I do not permit
you the privilege. Except that she retains your name&mdash;and the
moment you attempt to rob her of that I shall destroy
you!&mdash;except for that, you have no further relations with
her&mdash;nothing to do or undo; no voice as to the disposal of
what remains of her; no power, no will, no influence in her fate.
<i>I</i> supplant you; I take my own again; I reassume a
responsibility temporarily taken from me. And <i>now</i>, I think,
you understand!"</p>
<p>He gave him one level and deadly stare; then his pallid features
relaxed, he slowly walked past Ruthven, grave, preoccupied;
unlocked the door, and passed out.</p>
<hr style='width: 45%;' />
<p>His lodgings were not imposing in their furnishings or
dimensions&mdash;a very small bedroom in the neighbourhood of Sixth
Avenue and Washington Square&mdash;but the heavy and increasing
drain on his resources permitted nothing better now; and what with
settling Gerald's complications and providing two nurses and a
private suite at Clifton for Alixe Ruthven, he had been obliged to
sell a number of securities, which reduced his income to a figure
too absurd to worry over.</p>
<p>However, the Government had at last signified its intention of
testing his invention&mdash;Chaosite&mdash;and there was that
chance for better things in prospect. Also, in time, Gerald would
probably be able to return something of the loans made. But these
things did not alleviate present stringent conditions, nor were
they likely to for a long while; and Selwyn, tired and perplexed,
mounted the stairs of his lodging-house and laid his overcoat on
the iron bed, and, divesting himself of the garments of ceremony as
a matter of economy, pulled on an old tweed shooting-jacket and
trousers.</p>
<p>Then, lighting his pipe&mdash;cigars being now on the expensive
and forbidden list&mdash;he drew a chair to his table and sat down,
resting his worn face between both hands. Truly the world was not
going very well with him in these days.</p>
<p>For some time, now, it had been his custom to face his
difficulties here in the silence of his little bedroom, seated
alone at his table, pipe gripped between his firm teeth, his strong
hands framing his face. Here he would sit for hours, the long day
ended, staring steadily at the blank wall, the gas-jet flickering
overhead; and here, slowly, painfully, with doubt and hesitation,
out of the moral confusion in his weary mind he evolved the theory
of personal responsibility.</p>
<p>With narrowing eyes, from which slowly doubt faded, he gazed at
duty with all the calm courage of his race, not at first
recognising it as duty in its new and dreadful guise.</p>
<p>But night after night, patiently perplexed, he retraced his
errant pathway through life, back to the source of doubt and pain;
and, once arrived there, he remained, gazing with impartial eyes
upon the ruin two young souls had wrought of their twin lives; and
always, always somehow, confronting him among the d&eacute;bris,
rose the spectre of their deathless responsibility to one another;
and the inexorable life-sentence sounded ceaselessly in his ears:
"For better or for worse&mdash;for better or for worse&mdash;till
death do us part&mdash;till death&mdash;till death!"</p>
<p>Dreadful his duty&mdash;for man already had dared to sunder
them, and he had acquiesced to save her in the eyes of the world!
Dreadful, indeed&mdash;because he knew that he had never loved her,
never could love her! Dreadful&mdash;doubly dreadful&mdash;for he
now knew what love might be; and it was not what he had believed it
when he executed the contract which must bind him while life
endured.</p>
<p>Once, and not long since, he thought that, freed from the sad
disgrace of the shadowy past, he had begun life anew. They told
him&mdash;and he told himself&mdash;that a man had that right; that
a man was no man who stood stunned and hopeless, confronting the
future in fetters of conscience. And by that token he had accepted
the argument as truth&mdash;because he desired to believe
it&mdash;and he had risen erect and shaken himself free of the
past&mdash;as he supposed; as though the past, which becomes part
of us, can be shaken from tired shoulders with the first shudder of
revolt!</p>
<p>No; he understood now that the past was part of him&mdash;as his
limbs and head and body and mind were part of him. It had to be
reckoned with&mdash;what he had done to himself, to the young girl
united to him in bonds indissoluble except in death.</p>
<p>That she had strayed&mdash;under man-made laws held
guiltless&mdash;could not shatter the tie. That he, blinded by
hope, had hoped to remake a life already made, and had dared to
masquerade before his own soul as a man free to come, to go, and
free to love, could not alter what had been done. Back, far back of
it all lay the deathless pact&mdash;for better or for worse. And
nothing man might wish or say or do could change it. Always, always
he must remain bound by that, no matter what others did or thought;
always, always he was under obligations to the end.</p>
<p>And now, alone, abandoned, helplessly sick, utterly dependent
upon the decency, the charity, the mercy of her legal paramour, the
young girl who had once been his wife had not turned to him in
vain.</p>
<p>Before the light of her shaken mind had gone out she had written
him, incoherently, practically <i>in extremis</i>; and if he had
hitherto doubted where his duty lay, from that moment he had no
longer any doubt. And very quietly, hopelessly, and irrevocably he
had crushed out of his soul the hope and promise of the new life
dawning for him above the dead ashes of the past.</p>
<hr style='width: 45%;' />
<p>It was not easy to do; he had not ended it yet. He did not know
how. There were ties to be severed, friendships to be gently
broken, old scenes to be forgotten, memories to kill. There was
also love&mdash;to be disposed of. And he did not know how.</p>
<p>First of all, paramount in his hopeless trouble, the desire to
save others from pain persisted.</p>
<p>For that reason he had been careful that Gerald should not know
where and how he was now obliged to live&mdash;lest the boy suspect
and understand how much of Selwyn's little fortune it had taken to
settle his debts of "honour" and free him from the sinister
pressure of Neergard's importunities.</p>
<p>For that reason, too, he dreaded to have Austin know, because,
if the truth were exposed, nothing in the world could prevent a
violent and final separation between him and the foolish boy who
now, at last, was beginning to show the first glimmering traces of
character and common sense.</p>
<p>So he let it be understood that his address was his club for the
present; for he also desired no scene with Boots, whom he knew
would attempt to force him to live with him in his cherished and
brand-new house. And even if he cared to accept and permit Boots to
place him under such obligations, it would only hamper him in his
duties.</p>
<p>Because now, what remained of his income must be devoted to
Alixe.</p>
<p>Even before her case had taken the more hopeless turn, he had
understood that she could not remain at Clifton. Such cases were
neither desired nor treated there; he understood that. And so he
had taken, for her, a pretty little villa at Edgewater, with two
trained nurses to care for her, and a phaeton for her to drive.</p>
<p>And now she was installed there, properly cared for, surrounded
by every comfort, contented&mdash;except in the black and violent
crises which still swept her in recurrent storms&mdash;indeed,
tranquil and happy; for through the troubled glimmer of departing
reason, her eyes were already opening in the calm, unearthly dawn
of second childhood.</p>
<p>Pain, sadness, the desolate awakening to dishonour had been
forgotten; to her, the dead now lived; to her, the living who had
been children with her were children again, and she a child among
them. Outside of that dead garden of the past, peopled by laughing
phantoms of her youth, but one single extraneous memory
persisted&mdash;the memory of Selwyn&mdash;curiously twisted and
readjusted to the comprehension of a child's mind&mdash;vague at
times, at times wistfully elusive and incoherent&mdash;but it
remained always a memory, and always a happy one.</p>
<p>He was obliged to go to her every three or four days. In the
interim she seemed quite satisfied and happy, busy with the simple
and pretty things she now cared for; but toward the third day of
his absence she usually became restless, asking for him, and why he
did not come. And then they telegraphed him, and he left everything
and went, white-faced, stern of lip, to endure the most dreadful
ordeal a man may face&mdash;to force the smile to his lips and
gaiety into the shrinking soul of him, and sit with her in the
pretty, sunny room, listening to her prattle, answering the
childish questions, watching her, seated in her rocking-chair,
singing contentedly to herself, and playing with her dolls and
ribbons&mdash;dressing them, undressing, mending,
arranging&mdash;until the heart within him quivered under the
misery of it, and he turned to the curtained window, hands
clinching convulsively, and teeth set to force back the strangling
agony in his throat.</p>
<p>And the dreadful part of it all was that her appearance had
remained unchanged&mdash;unless, perhaps, she was prettier,
lovelier of face and figure than ever before; but in her beautiful
dark eyes only the direct intelligence of a child answered his gaze
of inquiry; and her voice, too, had become soft and hesitating, and
the infantile falsetto sounded in it at times, sweet, futile,
immature.</p>
<hr style='width: 45%;' />
<p>Thinking of these things now, he leaned heavily forward, elbows
on the little table. And, suddenly unbidden, before his haunted
eyes rose the white portico of Silverside, and the greensward
glimmered, drenched in sunshine, and a slim figure in white stood
there, arms bare, tennis-bat swinging in one tanned little
hand.</p>
<p>Voices were sounding in his ears&mdash;Drina's laughter,
Lansing's protest; Billy shouting to his eager pack; his sister's
calm tones, admonishing the young&mdash;and through it all,
<i>her</i> voice, clear, hauntingly sweet, pronouncing his
name.</p>
<p>And he set his lean jaws tight and took a new grip on his
pipe-stem, and stared, with pain-dulled eyes, at the white wall
opposite.</p>
<p>But on the blank expanse the faintest tinge of colour appeared,
growing clearer, taking shape as he stared; and slowly, slowly,
under the soft splendour of her hair, two clear eyes of darkest
blue opened under the languid lids and looked at him, and looked
and looked until he closed his own, unable to endure the agony.</p>
<p>But even through his sealed lids he saw her; and her clear gaze
pierced him, blinded as he was, leaning there, both hands pressed
across his eyes.</p>
<p>Sooner or later&mdash;sooner or later he must write to her and
tell what must be told. How to do it, when to do it, he did not
know. What to say he did not know; but that there was something due
her from him&mdash;something to say, something to confess&mdash;to
ask her pardon for&mdash;he understood.</p>
<p>Happily for her&mdash;happily for him, alas!&mdash;love, in its
full miracle, had remained beyond her comprehension. That she cared
for him with all her young heart he knew; that she had not come to
love him he knew, too. So that crowning misery of happiness was
spared him.</p>
<p>Yet he knew, too, that there had been a chance for him; that her
awakening had not been wholly impossible. Loyal in his soul to the
dread duty before him, he must abandon hope; loyal in his heart to
her, he must abandon her, lest, by chance, in the calm, still
happiness of their intimacy the divine moment, unheralded, flash
out through the veil, dazzling, blinding them with the splendour of
its truth and beauty.</p>
<p>And now, leaning there, his face buried in his hands, hours that
he spent with her came crowding back upon him, and in his ears her
voice echoed and echoed, and his hands trembled with the scented
memory of her touch, and his soul quivered and cried out for
her.</p>
<p>Storm after storm swept him; and in the tempest he abandoned
reason, blinded, stunned, crouching there with head lowered and his
clenched hands across his face.</p>
<p>But storms, given right of way, pass on and over, and tempests
sweep hearts cleaner; and after a long while he lifted his bowed
head and sat up, squaring his shoulders.</p>
<p>Presently he picked up his pipe again, held it a moment, then
laid it aside. Then he leaned forward, breathing deeply but
quietly, and picked up a pen and a sheet of paper. For the time had
come for his letter to her, and he was ready.</p>
<p>The letter he wrote was one of those gay, cheerful,
inconsequential letters which, from the very beginning of their
occasional correspondence, had always been to her most welcome and
delightful.</p>
<p>Ignoring that maturity in her with which he had lately dared to
reckon, he reverted to the tone which he had taken and maintained
with her before the sweetness and seriousness of their relations
had deepened to an intimacy which had committed him to an
avowal.</p>
<p>News of all sorts humorously retailed&mdash;an amusing sketch of
his recent journey to Washington and its doubtful
results&mdash;matters that they both were interested in, details
known only to them, a little harmless gossip&mdash;these things
formed the body of his letter. There was never a hint of sorrow or
discouragement&mdash;nothing to intimate that life had so utterly
and absolutely changed for him&mdash;only a jolly, friendly
badinage&mdash;an easy, light-hearted narrative, ending in messages
to all and a frank regret that the pursuit of business and
happiness appeared incompatible at the present moment.</p>
<p>His address, he wrote, was his club; he sent her, he said, under
separate cover, a rather interesting pamphlet&mdash;a monograph on
the symbolism displayed by the designs in Samarcand rugs and
textiles of the Ming dynasty. And he ended, closing with a gentle
jest concerning blue-stockings and rebellious locks of ruddy
hair.</p>
<p>And signed his name.</p>
<hr style='width: 45%;' />
<p>Nina and Eileen, in travelling gowns and veils, stood on the
porch at Silverside, waiting for the depot wagon, when Selwyn's
letter was handed to Eileen.</p>
<p>The girl flushed up, then, avoiding Nina's eyes, turned and
entered the house. Once out of sight, she swiftly mounted to her
own room and dropped, breathless, on the bed, tearing the envelope
from end to end. And from end to end, and back again and over
again, she read the letter&mdash;at first in expectancy, lips
parted, colour brilliant, then with the smile still curving her
cheeks&mdash;but less genuine now&mdash;almost
mechanical&mdash;until the smile stamped on her stiffening lips
faded, and the soft contours relaxed, and she lifted her eyes,
staring into space with a wistful, questioning lift of the pure
brows.</p>
<p>What more had she expected? What more had she desired? Nothing,
surely, of that emotion which she declined to recognise; surely not
that sentiment of which she had admitted her ignorance to him.
Again her eyes sought the pages, following the inked writing from
end to end. What was she seeking there that he had left unwritten?
What was she searching for, of which there was not one hint in all
these pages?</p>
<p>And now Nina was calling her from the hall below; and she
answered gaily and, hiding the letter in her long glove, came down
the stairs.</p>
<p>"I'll tell you all about the letter in the train," she said; "he
is perfectly well, and evidently quite happy; and Nina&mdash;"</p>
<p>"What, dear?"</p>
<p>"I want to send him a telegram. May I?"</p>
<p>"A dozen, if you wish," said Mrs. Gerard, "only, if you don't
climb into that vehicle, we'll miss the train."</p>
<p>So on the way to Wyossette station Eileen sat very still, gloved
hands folded in her lap, composing her telegram to Selwyn. And,
once in the station, having it by heart already, she wrote it
rapidly:</p>
<div class="blockquot">
<p>"Nina and I are on our way to the Berkshires for a week.
House-party at the Craigs'. We stay overnight in town. E.E."</p>
</div>
<p>But the telegram went to his club, and waited for him there; and
meanwhile another telegram arrived at his lodgings, signed by a
trained nurse; and while Miss Erroll, in the big, dismantled house,
lay in a holland-covered armchair, waiting for him, while Nina and
Austin, reading their evening papers, exchanged significant glances
from time to time, the man she awaited sat in the living-room in a
little villa at Edgewater. And a slim young nurse stood beside him,
cool and composed in her immaculate uniform, watching the play of
light and shadow on a woman who lay asleep on the couch, fresh,
young face flushed and upturned, a child's doll cradled between arm
and breast.</p>
<hr style='width: 45%;' />
<p>"How long has she been asleep?" asked Selwyn under his
breath.</p>
<p>"An hour. She fretted a good deal because you had not come. This
afternoon she said she wished to drive, and I had the phaeton
brought around; but when she saw it she changed her mind. I was
rather afraid of an outburst&mdash;they come sometimes from less
cause than that&mdash;so I did not urge her to go out. She played
on the piano for a long while, and sang some songs&mdash;those
curious native songs she learned in Manila. It seemed to soothe
her; she played with her little trifles quite contentedly for a
time, but soon began fretting again, and asking why you had not
come. She had a bad hour later&mdash;she is quite exhausted now.
Could you stay to-night, Captain Selwyn?"</p>
<p>"Y-es, if you think it better. . . . Wait a moment; I think she
has awakened."</p>
<p>Alixe had turned her head, her lovely eyes wide open.</p>
<p>"Phil!" she cried, "is it you?"</p>
<p>He went forward and took the uplifted hands, smiling down at
her.</p>
<p>"Such a horrid dream!" she said pettishly, "about a soft, plump
man with ever so many rings on his hands. . . . Oh, I am glad you
came. . . . Look at this child of mine!" cuddling the staring wax
doll closer; "she's not undressed yet, and it's long, long after
bedtime. Hand me her night-clothes, Phil."</p>
<p>The slim young nurse bent and disentangled a bit of lace and
cambric from a heap on the floor, offering it to Selwyn. He laid it
in the hand Alixe held out, and she began to undress the doll in
her arms, prattling softly all the while:</p>
<p>"Late&mdash;oh, so very, very late! I must be more careful of
her, Phil; because, if you and I grow up, some day we may marry,
and we ought to know all about children. It would be great fun,
wouldn't it?"</p>
<p>He nodded, forcing a smile.</p>
<p>"Don't you think so?" she persisted.</p>
<p>"Yes&mdash;yes, indeed," he said gently.</p>
<p>She laughed, contented with his answer, and laid her lips
against the painted face of the doll.</p>
<p>"When we grow up, years from now&mdash;then we'll understand,
won't we, Phil? . . . I am tired with playing. . . . And
Phil&mdash;let me whisper something. Is that person gone?"</p>
<p>He turned and signed to the nurse, who quietly withdrew.</p>
<p>"Is she gone?" repeated Alixe.</p>
<p>"Yes."</p>
<p>"Then listen, Phil. Do you know what she and the other one are
about all day? <i>I</i> know; I pretend not to, but I know. They
are watching me every moment&mdash;always watching me, because they
want to make you believe that I am forgetting you. But I am not.
That is why I made them send for you so I could tell you myself
that I could never, never forget you. . . . I think of you always
while I am playing&mdash;always&mdash;always I am thinking of you.
You will believe it, won't you?"</p>
<p>"Yes," he said.</p>
<p>Contented, she turned to her doll again, undressing it deftly,
tenderly.</p>
<p>"At moments," she said, "I have an odd idea that it is real. I
am not quite sure even now. Do you believe it is alive, Phil?
Perhaps, at night, when I am asleep, it becomes alive. . . . This
morning I awoke, laughing, laughing in delight&mdash;thinking I
heard you laughing, too&mdash;as once&mdash;in the dusk where there
were many roses and many stars&mdash;big stars, and very, very
bright&mdash;I saw you&mdash;saw you&mdash;and the
roses&mdash;"</p>
<p>She paused with a pained, puzzled look of appeal.</p>
<p>"Where was it, Phil?"</p>
<p>"In Manila town."</p>
<p>"Yes; and there were roses. But I was never there."</p>
<p>"You came out on the veranda and pelted me with roses. There
were others there&mdash;officers and their wives. Everybody was
laughing."</p>
<p>"Yes&mdash;but I was not there, Phil. . . . Who&mdash;who was
the tall, thin bugler who sounded taps?"</p>
<p>"Corrigan."</p>
<p>"And&mdash;the little, girl-shaped, brown men?"</p>
<p>"My constabulary."</p>
<p>"I can't recollect," she said listlessly, laying the doll
against her breast. "I think, Phil, that you had better be a little
quiet now&mdash;she may wish to sleep. And I am sleepy, too,"
lifting her slender hand as a sign for him to take his leave.</p>
<p>As he went out the nurse said: "If you wish to return to town,
you may, I think. She will forget about you for two or three days,
as usual. Shall I telegraph if she becomes restless?"</p>
<p>"Yes. What does the doctor say to-day?"</p>
<p>The slim nurse looked at him under level brows.</p>
<p>"There is no change," she said.</p>
<p>"No hope." It was not even a question.</p>
<p>"No hope, Captain Selwyn."</p>
<p>He stood silent, tapping his leg with the stiff brim of his hat;
then, wearily: "Is there anything more I can do for her?"</p>
<p>"Nothing, sir."</p>
<p>"Thank you."</p>
<p>He turned away, bidding her good-night in a low voice.</p>
<hr style='width: 45%;' />
<p>He arrived in town about midnight, but did not go to any of his
clubs. At one of them a telegram was awaiting him; and in a
dismantled and summer-shrouded house a young girl was still
expecting him, lying with closed eyes in a big holland-covered
arm-chair, listening to the rare footfalls in the street
outside.</p>
<p>But of these things he knew nothing; and he went wearily to his
lodgings and climbed the musty stairs, and sat down in his old
attitude before the table and the blank wall behind it, waiting for
the magic frescoes to appear in all the vague loveliness of their
hues and dyes, painting for him upon his chamber-walls the tinted
paradise now lost to him for ever.</p>
<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XI" id="CHAPTER_XI"></a>CHAPTER XI</h2>
<h3>HIS OWN WAY</h3>
<p>The winter promised to be a busy one for Selwyn. If at first he
had had any dread of enforced idleness, that worry, at least,
vanished before the first snow flew. For there came to him a secret
communication from the Government suggesting, among other things,
that he report, three times a week, at the proving grounds on Sandy
Hook; that experiments with Chaosite as a bursting charge might
begin as soon as he was ready with his argon primer; that officers
connected with the bureau of ordnance and the marine laboratory had
recommended the advisability of certain preliminary tests, and that
the general staff seemed inclined to consider the matter
seriously.</p>
<p>This meant work&mdash;hard, constant, patient work. But it did
not mean money to help him support the heavy burdens he had
assumed. If there were to be any returns, all that part of it lay
in the future, and the future could not help him now.</p>
<p>Yet, unless still heavier burdens were laid upon him, he could
hold on for the present; his bedroom cost him next to nothing;
breakfast he cooked for himself, luncheon he dispensed with, and he
dined at random&mdash;anywhere that appeared to promise seclusion,
cheapness, and immunity from anybody he had ever known.</p>
<p>A minute and rather finicky care of his wardrobe had been second
nature to him&mdash;the habits of a soldier systematised the
routine&mdash;and he was satisfied that his clothes would outlast
winter demands, although laundry expenses appalled him.</p>
<p>As for his clubs, he hung on to them, knowing the importance of
appearances in a town which is made up of them. But this expense
was all he could carry, for the demands of the establishment at
Edgewater were steadily increasing with the early coming of winter;
he was sent for oftener, and a physician was now in practically
continual attendance.</p>
<p>Also, three times a week he boarded the Sandy Hook boat,
returning always at night because he dared not remain at the
reservation lest an imperative telegram from Edgewater find him
unable to respond.</p>
<p>So, when in November the first few hurrying snow-flakes whirled
in among the city's canons of masonry and iron, Selwyn had already
systematised his winter schedule; and when Nina opened her house,
returning from Lenox with Eileen to do so, she found that Selwyn
had made his own arrangements for the winter, and that, according
to the programme, neither she nor anybody else was likely to see
him oftener than one evening in a week.</p>
<p>To Boots she complained bitterly, having had visions of Selwyn
and Gerald as permanent fixtures of family support during the
season now imminent.</p>
<p>"I cannot understand," she said, "why Philip is acting this way.
He need not work like that; there is no necessity, because he has a
comfortable income. If he is determined to maintain a stuffy
apartment somewhere, of course I won't insist on his coming to us
as he ought to, but to abandon us in this manner makes me almost
indignant. Besides, it's having anything but a salutary effect on
Eileen."</p>
<p>"What effect is it having on Eileen?" inquired Boots
curiously.</p>
<p>"Oh, I don't know," said Nina, coming perilously close to a
pout; "but I see symptoms&mdash;indeed I do, Boots!&mdash;symptoms
of shirking the winter's routine. It's to be a gay season, too, and
it's only her second. The idea of a child of that age informing me
that she's had enough of the purely social phases of this planet!
Did you ever hear anything like it? One season, if you
please&mdash;and she finds it futile, stale, and unprofitable to
fulfil the duties expected of her!"</p>
<p>Boots began to laugh, but it was no laughing matter to Nina, and
she said so vigorously.</p>
<p>"It's Philip's fault. If he'd stand by us this winter she'd go
anywhere&mdash;and enjoy it, too. Besides, he's the only man able
to satisfy the blue-stocking in her between dances. But he's got
this obstinate mania for seclusion, and he seldom comes near us,
and it's driving Eileen into herself, Boots&mdash;and every day I
catch her hair slumping over her ears&mdash;and once I discovered a
lead-pencil behind 'em!&mdash;and a monograph on the Ming dynasty
in her lap, all marked up with notes! Oh, Boots! Boots! I've given
up all hopes of that brother of mine for her&mdash;but she could
marry anybody, if she chose&mdash;<i>anybody</i>!&mdash;and she
could twist the entire social circus into a court of her own and
dominate everything. Everybody knows it; everybody says it! . . .
And look at her!&mdash;indifferent, listless, scarcely civil any
longer to her own sort, but galvanised into animation the moment
some impossible professor or artist or hairy scientist flutters
batlike into a drawing-room where he doesn't belong unless he's
hired to be amusing! And that sounds horridly snobbish, I know; I
<i>am</i> a snob about Eileen, but not about myself because it
doesn't harm me to make round wonder-eyes at a Herr Professor or
gaze intensely into the eyes of an artist when he's ornamental; it
doesn't make my hair come down over my ears to do that sort of
thing, and it doesn't corrupt me into slinking off to museum
lectures or spending mornings prowling about the Society Library or
the Chinese jades in the Metropolitan&mdash;"</p>
<p>Boots's continuous and unfeigned laughter checked the pretty,
excited little matron, and after a moment she laughed, too.</p>
<p>"Dear Boots," she said, "can't you help me a little? I really am
serious. I don't know what to do with the girl. Philip never comes
near us&mdash;once a week for an hour or two, which is
nothing&mdash;and the child misses him. There&mdash;the murder is
out! Eileen misses him. Oh, she doesn't say so&mdash;she doesn't
hint it, or look it; but I know her; I know. She misses him; she's
lonely. And what to do about it I don't know, Boots, I don't
know."</p>
<p>Lansing had ceased laughing. He had been indulging in
tea&mdash;a shy vice of his which led him to haunt houses where
that out-of-fashion beverage might still be had. And now he sat,
cup suspended, saucer held meekly against his chest, gazing out at
the pelting snow-flakes.</p>
<p>"Boots, dear," said Nina, who adored him, "tell me what to do.
Tell me what has gone amiss between my brother and Eileen.
Something has. And whatever it is, it began last autumn&mdash;that
day when&mdash;you remember the incident?"</p>
<p>Boots nodded.</p>
<p>"Well, it seemed to upset everybody, somehow. Philip left the
next day; do you remember? And Eileen has never been quite the
same. Of course, I don't ascribe it to that unpleasant
episode&mdash;even a young girl gets over a shock in a day. But
the&mdash;the change&mdash;or whatever it is&mdash;dated from that
night. . . . They&mdash;Philip and Eileen&mdash;had been
inseparable. It was good for them&mdash;for her, too. And as for
Phil&mdash;why, he looked about twenty-one! . . . Boots, I&mdash;I
had hoped&mdash;expected&mdash;and I was right! They <i>were</i> on
the verge of it!"</p>
<p>"I think so, too," he said.</p>
<p>She looked up curiously.</p>
<p>"Did Philip ever say&mdash;"</p>
<p>"No; he never <i>says</i>, you know."</p>
<p>"I thought that men&mdash;close friends&mdash;sometimes
did."</p>
<p>"Sometimes&mdash;in romantic fiction. Phil wouldn't; nor," he
added smilingly, "would I."</p>
<p>"How do you know, Boots?" she asked, leaning back to watch him
out of mischievous eyes. "How do you know what you'd do if you were
in love&mdash;with Gladys, for example?"</p>
<p>"I know perfectly well," he said, "because I am."</p>
<p>"In love!" incredulously.</p>
<p>"Of course."</p>
<p>"Oh&mdash;you mean Drina."</p>
<p>"Who else?" he asked lightly.</p>
<p>"I thought you were speaking seriously. I"&mdash;all her latent
instinct for such meddling aroused&mdash;"I thought perhaps you
meant Gladys."</p>
<p>"Gladys who?" he asked blandly.</p>
<p>"Gladys Orchil, silly! People said&mdash;"</p>
<p>"Oh, Lord!" he exclaimed; "if people 'said,' then it's all over.
Nina! do I look like a man on a still hunt for a million?"</p>
<p>"Gladys is a beauty!" retorted Nina indignantly.</p>
<p>"With the intellect of a Persian kitten," he nodded.
"I&mdash;that was not a nice thing to say. I'm sorry. I'm ashamed.
But, do you know, I have come to regard my agreement with Drina so
seriously that I take absolutely no interest in anybody else."</p>
<p>"Try to be serious, Boots," said Nina. "There are dozens of nice
girls you ought to be agreeable to. Austin and I were saying only
last night what a pity it is that you don't find either of the
Minster twins interesting&mdash;"</p>
<p>"I might find them compoundly interesting," he admitted, "but
unfortunately there's no chance in this country for multiple
domesticity and the simpler pleasures of a compound life. It's no
use, Nina; I'm not going to marry any girl for ever so
long&mdash;anyway, not until Drina releases me on her eighteenth
birthday. Hello!&mdash;somebody's coming&mdash;and I'm off!"</p>
<p>"I'm not at home; don't go!" said Nina, laying one hand on his
arm to detain him as a card was brought up. "Oh, it's only Rosamund
Fane! I <i>did</i> promise to go to the Craigs' with her. . . . Do
you mind if she comes up?"</p>
<p>"Not if you don't," said Boots blandly. He could not endure
Rosamund and she detested him; and Nina, who was perfectly aware of
this, had just enough of perversity in her to enjoy their
meeting.</p>
<p>Rosamund came in breezily, sables powdered with tiny flecks of
snow, cheeks like damask roses, eyes of turquoise.</p>
<p>"How d'ye do!" she nodded, greeting Boots askance as she closed
with Nina. "I came, you see, but <i>do</i> you want to be jammed
and mauled and trodden on at the Craigs'? No? That's
perfect!&mdash;neither do I. Where is the adorable Eileen? Nobody
sees her any more."</p>
<p>"She was at the Delmour-Carnes's yesterday."</p>
<p>"Was she? Curious I didn't see her. Tea? With gratitude, dear,
if it's Scotch."</p>
<p>She sat erect, the furs sliding to the back of the chair,
revealing the rather accented details of her perfectly turned
figure; and rolling up her gloves she laid her pretty head on one
side and considered Boots with very bright and malicious eyes.</p>
<p>"They say," she said, smiling, "that some very heavy play goes
on in that cunning little new house of yours, Mr. Lansing."</p>
<p>"Really?" he asked blandly.</p>
<p>"Yes; and I'm wondering if it is true."</p>
<p>"I shouldn't think you'd care, Mrs. Fane, as long as it makes a
good story."</p>
<p>Rosamund flushed. Then, always alive to humour, laughed
frankly.</p>
<p>"What a nasty thing to say to a woman!" she observed; "it fairly
reeks impertinence. Mr. Lansing, you don't like me very well, do
you?"</p>
<p>"I dare not," he said, "because you are married. If you were
only free <i>a vinculo matrimonii</i>&mdash;"</p>
<p>Rosamund laughed again, and sat stroking her muff and smiling.
"Curious, isn't it?" she said to Nina&mdash;"the inborn antipathy
of two agreeable human bipeds for one another. <i>Similis simili
gaudet</i>&mdash;as my learned friend will admit. But with us it's
the old, old case of that eminent practitioner, the late Dr. Fell.
<i>Esto perpetua!</i> Oh, well! We can't help it, can we, Mr.
Lansing?" And again to Nina: "Dear, <i>have</i> you heard anything
about Alixe Ruthven? I think it is the strangest thing that nobody
seems to know where she is. And all anybody can get out of Jack is
that she's in a nerve factory&mdash;or some such retreat&mdash;and
a perfect wreck. She might as well be dead, you know."</p>
<p>"In that case," observed Lansing, "it might be best to shift the
centre of gossip. <i>De mortuis nil nisi bonum</i>&mdash;which is
simple enough for anybody to comprehend."</p>
<p>"That is rude, Mr. Lansing," flashed out Rosamund; and to his
astonishment he saw the tears start to her eyes.</p>
<p>"I beg your pardon," he said sulkily.</p>
<p>"You do well to. I care more for Alixe Ruthven than&mdash;than
you give me credit for caring about anybody. People are never
wholly worthless, Mr. Lansing&mdash;only the very young think that.
Give me credit for one wholly genuine affection, and you will not
be too credulous; and perhaps in future you and I may better be
able to endure one another when Fate lands us at the same
tea-table."</p>
<p>Boots said respectfully: "I am sorry for what I said, Mrs. Pane.
I hope that your friend Mrs. Ruthven will soon recover."</p>
<p>Rosamund looked at Nina, the tears still rimming her lids. "I
miss her frightfully," she said. "If somebody would only tell me
where she is&mdash;I&mdash;I know it could do no harm for me to see
her. I <i>can</i> be as gentle and loyal as anybody&mdash;when I
really care for a person. . . . Do <i>you</i> know where she might
be, Nina?"</p>
<p>"I? No, I do not. I'd tell you if I did, Rosamund."</p>
<p>"<i>Don't</i> you know?"</p>
<p>"Why, no," said Nina, surprised at her persistence.</p>
<p>"Because," continued Rosamund, "your brother does."</p>
<p>Nina straightened up, flushed and astonished.</p>
<p>"Why do you say that?" she asked.</p>
<p>"Because he does know. He sent her to Clifton. The maid who
accompanied her is in my service now. It's a low way of finding out
things, but we all do it."</p>
<p>"He&mdash;sent Alixe to&mdash;to Clifton!" repeated Nina
incredulously. "Your maid told you that?"</p>
<p>Rosamund finished the contents of her slim glass and rose. "Yes;
and it was a brave and generous and loyal thing for him to do. I
supposed you knew it. Jack has been too beastly to her; she was on
the verge of breaking down when I saw her on the <i>Niobrara</i>,
and she told me then that her husband had practically repudiated
her. . . . Then she suddenly disappeared; and her maid, later, came
to me seeking a place. That's how I knew, and that's all I know.
And I care for Alixe; and I honour your brother for what he
did."</p>
<p>She stood with pretty golden head bent, absently arranging the
sables around her neck and shoulders.</p>
<p>"I have been very horrid to Captain Selwyn," she said quietly.
"Tell him I am sorry; that he has my respect. . . . And&mdash;if he
cares to tell me where Alixe is I shall be grateful and do no
harm."</p>
<p>She turned toward the door, stopped short, came back, and made
her adieux, then started again toward the door, not noticing
Lansing.</p>
<p>"With your permission," said Boots at her shoulder in a very low
voice.</p>
<p>She looked up, surprised, her eyes still wet. Then comprehending
the compliment of his attendance, acknowledged it with a faint
smile.</p>
<p>"Good-night," he said to Nina. Then he took Rosamund down to her
brougham with a silent formality that touched her present
sentimental mood.</p>
<p>She leaned from her carriage-window, looking at him where he
stood, hat in hand, in the thickly falling snow.</p>
<p>"Please&mdash;without ceremony, Mr. Lansing." And, as he covered
himself, "May I not drop you at your destination?"</p>
<p>"Thank you"&mdash;in refusal.</p>
<p>"I thank you for being nice to me. . . . Please believe there is
often less malice than perversity in me. I&mdash;I have a heart,
Mr. Lansing&mdash;such as it is. And often those I torment most I
care for most. It was so with Alixe. Good-bye."</p>
<p>Boots's salute was admirably formal; then he went on through the
thickening snow, swung vigorously across the Avenue to the
Park-wall, and, turning south, continued on parallel to it under
the naked trees.</p>
<p>It must have been thick weather on the river and along the
docks, for the deep fog-horns sounded persistently over the city,
and the haunted warning of the sirens filled the leaden sky
lowering through the white veil descending in flakes that melted
where they fell.</p>
<p>And, as Lansing strode on, hands deep in his overcoat, more than
one mystery was unravelling before his keen eyes that blinked and
winked as the clinging snow blotted his vision.</p>
<p>Now he began to understand something of the strange effacement
of his friend Selwyn; he began to comprehend the curious economies
practised, the continued absence from club and coterie, the choice
of the sordid lodging whither Boots, one night, seeing him on the
street by chance, had shamelessly tracked him&mdash;with no excuse
for the intrusion save his affection for this man and his secret
doubts of the man's ability to take care of himself and his occult
affairs.</p>
<p>Now he was going there, exactly what to do he did not yet know,
but with the vague determination to do something.</p>
<p>On the wet pavements and reeking iron overhead structure along
Sixth Avenue the street lights glimmered, lending to the filthy
avenue under its rusty tunnel a mystery almost picturesque.</p>
<p>Into it he turned, swung aboard a car as it shot groaning and
clanking around the curve from Fifty-ninth Street, and settled down
to brood and ponder and consider until it was time for him to swing
off the car into the slimy street once more.</p>
<p>Silvery pools of light inlaid the dim expanse of Washington
Square. He turned east, then south, then east again, and doubled
into a dim street, where old-time houses with toppling dormers
crowded huddling together as though in the cowering contact there
was safety from the destroyer who must one day come, bringing steel
girders and cement to mark their graves with sky-scraping monuments
of stone.</p>
<p>Into the doorway of one of these houses Lansing turned. When the
town was young a Lansing had lived there in pomp and
circumstance&mdash;his own great-grandfather&mdash;and he smiled
grimly, amused at the irony of things terrestrial.</p>
<p>A slattern at the door halted him:</p>
<p>"Nobody ain't let up them stairs without my knowin' why," she
mumbled.</p>
<p>"I want to see Captain Selwyn," he explained.</p>
<p>"Hey?"</p>
<p>"Captain Selwyn!"</p>
<p>"Hey? I'm a little deef!" screeched the old crone. "Is it Cap'n
Selwyn you want?"</p>
<p>Above, Selwyn, hearing his name screamed through the shadows of
the ancient house, came to the stairwell and looked down into the
blackness.</p>
<p>"What is it, Mrs. Glodden?" he said sharply; then, catching
sight of a dim figure springing up the stairs:</p>
<p>"Here! this way. Is it for me?" and as Boots came into the light
from his open door: "Oh!" he whispered, deadly pale under the
reaction; "I thought it was a telegram. Come in."</p>
<p>Boots shook the snow from his hat and coat into the passageway
and took the single chair; Selwyn, tall and gaunt in his shabby
dressing-gown, stood looking at him and plucking nervously at the
frayed and tasselled cord around his waist.</p>
<p>"I don't know how you came to stumble in here," he said at
length, "but I'm glad to see you."</p>
<p>"Thanks," replied Boots, gazing shamelessly and inquisitively
about. There was nothing to see except a few books, a pipe or two,
toilet articles, and a shaky gas-jet. The flat military trunk was
under the iron bed.</p>
<p>"I&mdash;it's not much of a place," observed Selwyn, forcing a
smile. "However, you see I'm so seldom in town; I'm busy at the
Hook, you know. So I don't require anything elaborate."</p>
<p>"Yes, I know," said Boots solemnly. A silence.</p>
<p>"H&mdash;have a pipe?" inquired Selwyn uneasily. He had nothing
else to offer.</p>
<p>Boots leaned back in his stiff chair, crossed his legs, and
filled a pipe. When he had lighted it he said:</p>
<p>"How are things, Phil?"</p>
<p>"All right. First rate, thank you."</p>
<p>Boots removed the pipe from his lips and swore at him; and
Selwyn listened with head obstinately lowered and lean hands
plucking at his frayed girdle. And when Boots had ended his
observations with an emphatic question, Selwyn shook his head:</p>
<p>"No, Boots. You're very good to ask me to stop with you, but I
can't. I'd be hampered; there are matters&mdash;affairs that
concern me&mdash;that need instant attention at times&mdash;at
certain times. I must be free to go, free to come. I couldn't be in
your house. Don't ask me. But I'm&mdash;I thank you for
offering&mdash;"</p>
<p>"Phil!"</p>
<p>"What?"</p>
<p>"Are you broke?"</p>
<p>"Ah&mdash;a little"&mdash;with a smile.</p>
<p>"Will you take what you require from me?"</p>
<p>"No."</p>
<p>"Oh&mdash;very well. I was horribly afraid you would."</p>
<p>Selwyn laughed and leaned back, indenting his meagre pillow.</p>
<p>"Come, Boots," he said, "you and I have often had worse quarters
than this. To tell you the truth I rather like it than
otherwise."</p>
<p>"Oh, damn!" said Boots, disgusted; "the same old conscience in
the same old mule! Who likes squalidity? I don't. You don't! What
if Fate has hit you a nasty swipe! Suppose Fortune has landed you a
few in the slats! It's only temporary and you know it. All business
in the world is conducted on borrowed capital. It's your business
to live in decent quarters, and I'm here to lend you the means of
conducting that business. Oh, come on, Phil, for Heaven's sake! If
there were really any reason&mdash;any logical reason for this
genius-in-the-garret business, I'd not say a word. But there isn't;
you're going to make money&mdash;"</p>
<p>"Oh, yes, I've got to," said Selwyn simply.</p>
<p>"Well, then! In the meanwhile&mdash;"</p>
<p>"No. Listen, Boots; I couldn't be free in your house.
I&mdash;they&mdash;there are telegrams&mdash;unexpected
ones&mdash;at all hours."</p>
<p>"What of it?"</p>
<p>"You don't understand."</p>
<p>"Wait a bit! How do you know I don't? Do the telegrams come from
Sandy Hook?"</p>
<p>"No."</p>
<p>Boots looked him calmly in the eye. "Then I <i>do</i>
understand, old man. Come on out of this, in Heaven's name! Come,
now! Get your dressing-gown off and your coat on! Don't you think I
understand? I tell you I <i>do</i>! Yes, the whole blessed,
illogical, chivalrous business. . . . Never mind how I
know&mdash;for I won't tell you! Oh, I'm not trying to interfere
with you; I know enough to shun buzz-saws. All I want is for you to
come and take that big back room and help a fellow live in a lonely
house&mdash;help a man to make it cheerful. I can't stand it alone
any longer; and it will be four years before Drina is
eighteen."</p>
<p>"Drina!" repeated Selwyn blankly&mdash;then he laughed. It was
genuine laughter, too; and Boots grinned and puffed at his pipe,
and recrossed his legs, watching Selwyn out of eyes brightening
with expectancy.</p>
<p>"Then it's settled," he said.</p>
<p>"What? Your ultimate career with Drina?"</p>
<p>"Oh, yes; that also. But I referred to your coming to live with
me."</p>
<p>"Boots&mdash;"</p>
<p>"Oh, fizz! Come on. I don't like the way you act, Phil."</p>
<p>Selwyn said slowly: "Do you make it a personal
matter&mdash;"</p>
<p>"Yes, I do; dam'f I don't! You'll be perfectly free there. I
don't care what you do or where you go or what hours you keep. You
can run up and down Broadway all night, if you want to, or you can
stop at home and play with the cats. I've three fine ones"&mdash;he
made a cup of his hands and breathed into them, for the room was
horribly cold&mdash;"three fine tabbies, and a good fire for 'em to
blink at when they start purring."</p>
<p>He looked kindly but anxiously at Selwyn, waiting for a word;
and as none came he said:</p>
<p>"Old fellow, you can't fool me with your talk about needing
nothing better because you're out of town all the time. You know
what you and I used to talk about in the old days&mdash;our longing
for a home and an open fire and a brace of cats and bedroom
slippers. Now I've got 'em, and I make Ardois signals at you. If
your shelter-tent got afire or blew away, wouldn't you crawl into
mine? And are you going to turn down an old tent-mate because his
shack happens to be built of bricks?"</p>
<p>"Do you put it that way?"</p>
<p>"Yes, I do. Why, in Heaven's name, do you want to stay in a vile
hole like this&mdash;unless you're smitten with Mrs. Glodden? Phil,
I <i>want</i> you to come. Will you?"</p>
<p>"Then&mdash;I'll accept a corner of your blanket&mdash;for a day
or two," said Selwyn wearily. . . . "You'll let me go when I want
to?"</p>
<p>"I'll do more; I'll make you go when <i>I</i> want you to. Come
on; pay Mrs. Glodden and have your trunk sent."</p>
<p>Selwyn forced a laugh, then sat up on the bed's edge and looked
around at the unpapered walls.</p>
<p>"Boots&mdash;you won't say to&mdash;to anybody what sort of a
place I've been living in&mdash;"</p>
<p>"No; but I will if you try to come back here."</p>
<p>So Selwyn stood up and began to remove his dressing-gown, and
Lansing dragged out the little flat trunk and began to pack it.</p>
<p>An hour later they went away together through the falling
snow.</p>
<hr style='width: 45%;' />
<p>For a week Boots let him alone. He had a big, comfortable room,
dressing-closet, and bath adjoining the suite occupied by his host;
he was absolutely free to go and come, and for a week or ten days
Boots scarcely laid eyes on him, except at breakfast, for Selwyn's
visits to Sandy Hook became a daily routine except when a telegram
arrived from Edgewater calling him there.</p>
<p>But matters at Edgewater were beginning to be easier in one way
for him. Alixe appeared to forget him for days at a time; she was
less irritable, less restless and exacting. A sweet-tempered and
childish docility made the care of her a simpler matter for the
nurses and for him; her discontent had disappeared; she made fewer
demands. She did ask for a sleigh to replace the phaeton, and
Selwyn managed to get one for her; and Miss Casson, one of the
nurses, wrote him how delighted Alixe had been, and how much good
the sleighing was doing her.</p>
<p>"Yesterday," continued the nurse in her letter, "there was a
consultation here between Drs. Vail, Wesson, and Morrison&mdash;as
you requested. They have not changed their opinions&mdash;indeed,
they are convinced that there is no possible chance of the recovery
you hoped for when you talked with Dr. Morrison. They all agree
that Mrs. Ruthven is in excellent physical condition&mdash;young,
strong, vigorous&mdash;and may live for years; may outlive us all.
But there is nothing else to expect."</p>
<p>The letter ran on:</p>
<p>"I am enclosing the bills you desired to have sent you. Fuel is
very expensive, as you will see. The items for fruits, too, seems
unreasonably large, but grapes are two dollars a pound and fresh
vegetables dreadfully expensive.</p>
<p>"Mrs. Ruthven is comfortable and happy in the luxury provided.
She is very sweet and docile with us all&mdash;and we are careful
not to irritate her or to have anything intrude which might excite
or cause the slightest shock to her.</p>
<p>"Yesterday, standing at the window, she caught sight of a
passing negro, and she turned to me like a flash and said:</p>
<p>"'The Tenth Cavalry were there!'</p>
<p>"She seemed rather excited for a moment&mdash;not
unpleasantly&mdash;but when I ventured to ask her a question, she
had quite forgotten it all.</p>
<p>"I meant to thank you for sending me the revolver and
cartridges. It seemed a silly request, but we are in a rather
lonely place, and I think Miss Bond and I feel a little safer
knowing that, in case of necessity, we have <i>something</i> to
frighten away any roaming intruder who might take it into his head
to visit us.</p>
<p>"One thing we must be careful about: yesterday Mrs. Ruthven had
a doll on my bed, and I sat sewing by the window, not noticing what
she was doing until I heard her pretty, pathetic little laugh.</p>
<p>"And <i>what</i> do you think she had done? She had discovered
your revolver under my pillow, and she had tied her handkerchief
around it, and was using it as a doll!</p>
<div class="blockquot">
<p>"I got it away with a little persuasion, but at times she still
asks for her 'army' doll&mdash;saying that a boy she knew, named
Philip, had sent it to her from Manila, where he was living.</p>
<p>"This, Captain Selwyn, is all the news. I do not think she will
begin to fret for you again for some time. At first, you remember,
it was every other day, then every three or four days. It has now
been a week since she asked for you. When she does I will, as
usual, telegraph you.</p>
<p>"With many thanks for your kindness to us all, "Very
respectfully yours,</p>
<p>"Mary Casson."</p>
</div>
<p>Selwyn read this letter sitting before the fire in the
living-room, feet on the fender, pipe between his teeth. It was the
first day of absolute rest he had had in a long while.</p>
<p>The day before he had been at the Hook until almost dark,
watching the firing of a big gun, and the results had been so
satisfactory that he was venturing to give himself a
holiday&mdash;unless wanted at Edgewater.</p>
<p>But the morning had brought this letter; Alixe was contented and
comfortable. So when Boots, after breakfast, went off to his Air
Line office, Selwyn permitted himself the luxury of smoking-jacket
and slippers, and settled down before the fire to reread the letter
and examine the enclosed bills, and ponder and worry over them at
his ease. To have leisure to worry over perplexities was something;
to worry in such luxury as this seemed something so very near to
happiness that as he refolded the last bill for household expenses
he smiled faintly to himself.</p>
<p>Boots's three tabby-cats were disposed comfortably before the
blaze, fore paws folded under, purring and blinking lazily at the
grate. All around were evidences of Boots's personal taste in
pretty wall-paper and hangings, a few handsome Shiraz rugs
underfoot, deep, comfortable chairs, low, open bookcases full of
promising literature&mdash;the more promising because not
contemporary.</p>
<p>Selwyn loved such a room as this&mdash;where all was comfort,
and nothing in the quiet, but cheerful, ensemble disturbed the
peaceful homeliness.</p>
<p>Once&mdash;and not very long since&mdash;he had persuaded
himself that there had been a chance for him to have such a home,
and live in it&mdash;<i>not</i> alone. That chance had
gone&mdash;had never really existed, he knew now. For sooner or
later he must have awakened from the pleasant dreams of
self-persuasion to the reality of his relentless responsibility.
No, there had never been such a chance; and he thanked God that he
had learned before it was too late that for him there could be no
earthly paradise, no fireside <i>&agrave; deux</i>, no home, no
hope of it.</p>
<p>As long as Alixe lived his spiritual responsibility must endure.
And they had just told him that she might easily outlive them
all.</p>
<p>He turned heavily in his chair and stared at the fire. Perhaps
he saw infernal visions in the flames; perhaps the blaze meant
nothing more to him than an example of chemical reaction, for his
face was set and colourless and vacant, and his hands lay loosely
along the padded arms of his easy-chair.</p>
<p>The hardest lesson he had to learn in these days was to avoid
thinking. Or, if he must surrender to the throbbing, unbidden
memories which came crowding in hordes to carry him by the
suddenness of their assault, that he learn to curb and subdue and
direct them in pity toward that hopeless, helpless, stricken
creature who was so utterly dependent upon him in her dreadful
isolation.</p>
<p>And he could not so direct them.</p>
<p>Loyal in act and deed, his thoughts betrayed him. Memories,
insurgent, turned on him to stab him; and he shrank from them,
cowering among his pillows at midnight. But memory is merciless,
and what has been is without pity; and so remembrance rose at
midnight from its cerements, like a spectre, floating before his
covered eyes, wearing the shape of youth and love, crowned with the
splendour of <i>her</i> hair, looking at him out of those clear,
sweet eyes whose gaze was purity and truth eternal.</p>
<p>And truth is truth, though he might lie with hands clinched
across his brow to shut out the wraith of it that haunted him;
though he might set his course by the faith that was in him, and
put away the hope of the world&mdash;whose hope is love&mdash;the
truth was there, staring, staring at him out of Eileen Erroll's
dark-blue eyes.</p>
<hr style='width: 45%;' />
<p>He had seen her seldom that winter. When he had seen her their
relations appeared to be as happy, as friendly as before; there was
no apparent constraint, nothing from her to indicate that she
noticed an absence for which his continual business with the
Government seemed sufficient excuse.</p>
<p>Besides, her days were full days, consequent upon Nina's goading
and indefatigable activity; and Eileen danced and received, and she
bridged and lunched, and she heard opera Wednesdays and was good to
the poor on Fridays; and there were balls, and theatres, and
classes for intellectual improvement, and routine duties incident
to obligations born with those inhabitants of Manhattan who are
numbered among the thousand caryatides that support upon their
jewelled necks and naked shoulders the social structure of the
metropolis.</p>
<p>But Selwyn, unable longer to fulfil his social obligations, was
being quietly eliminated from the social scheme of things. Passed
over here, dropped there, counted out as one more man not to be
depended upon, it was not a question of loss of caste; he simply
stayed away, and his absence was accepted by people who, in the
breathless pleasure chase, have no leisure to inquire why a man has
lagged behind.</p>
<p>There were rumours, however, that he had merely temporarily
donned overalls for the purpose of making a gigantic fortune; and
many an envious young fellow asked his pretty partner in the dance
if it was true, and many a young girl frankly hoped it was, and
that the fortune would be quick in the making. For Selwyn was well
liked in the younger set, and that he was in process of becoming
eligible interested everybody except Gladys and the Minster twins,
who considered him sufficiently eligible without the material
additions required by their cynical seniors, and would rather have
had him penniless and present than absent and opulent.</p>
<p>But they were young and foolish, and after a while they forgot
to miss him, particularly Gladys, whose mother had asked her not to
dance quite so often with Gerald, and to favour him a trifle less
frequently in cotillon. Which prevoyance had been coped with
successfully by Nina, who, noticing it, at first took merely a
perverse pleasure in foiling Mrs. Orchil; but afterward, as the
affair became noticeable, animated by the instinct of the truly
clever opportunist, she gave Gerald every fighting chance. Whatever
came of it&mdash;and, no doubt, the Orchils had more ambitious
views for Gladys&mdash;it was well to have Gerald mentioned in such
a fashionable episode, whether anything came of it or not.</p>
<p>Gerald, in the early days of his affair with Gladys, and before
even it had assumed the proportions of an affair, had shyly come to
Selwyn, not for confession but with the crafty purpose of
introducing her name into the conversation so that he might have
the luxury of talking about her to somebody who would neither quiz
him nor suspect him.</p>
<p>Selwyn, of course, ultimately suspected him; but as he never
quizzed him, Gerald continued his elaborate system of subterfuges
to make her personality and doings a topic for him to expand upon
and Selwyn to listen to.</p>
<p>It had amused Selwyn; he thought of it now&mdash;a gay memory
like a ray of light flung for a moment across the sombre background
of his own sadness. Fortunate or unfortunate, Gerald was still
lucky in his freedom to hazard it with chance and fate.</p>
<p>Freedom to love! That alone was blessed, though that love be
unreturned. Without that right&mdash;the right to love&mdash;a man
was no man. Lansing had been correct: such a man was a spectre in a
living world&mdash;the ghost of what he had been. But there was no
help for it, and there Lansing had been in the wrong. No hope, no
help, nothing for it but to set a true course and hang to it.</p>
<p>And Selwyn's dull eyes rested upon the ashes of the fire, and he
saw his dead youth among them; and, in the flames, his maturity
burning to embers.</p>
<p>If he outlived Alixe, his life would lie as the ashes lay at his
feet. If she outlived him&mdash;and they had told him there was
every chance of it&mdash;at least he would have something to busy
himself with in life if he was to leave her provided for when he
was no longer there to stand between her and charity.</p>
<p>That meant work&mdash;the hard, incessant, blinding, stupefying
work which stuns thought and makes such a life endurable.</p>
<p>Not that he had ever desired death as a refuge or as a solution
of despair; there was too much of the soldier in him. Besides, it
is so impossible for youth to believe in death, to learn to apply
the word to themselves. He had not learned to, and he had seen
death, and watched it; but for himself he had not learned to
believe in it. When one turns forty it is easier to credit it.</p>
<p>Thinking of death, impersonally, he sat watching the flames
playing above the heavy log; and as he lay there in his chair, the
unlighted pipe drooping in his hands, the telephone on the desk
rang, and he rose and unhooked the receiver.</p>
<p>Drina's voice sounded afar, and: "Hello, sweetheart!" he said
gaily; "is there anything I can do for your youthful highness?"</p>
<p>"I've been talking over the 'phone to Boots," she said. "You
know, whenever I have nothing to do I call up Boots at his office
and talk to him."</p>
<p>"That must please him," suggested Selwyn gravely.</p>
<p>"It does. Boots says you are not going to business to-day. So I
thought I'd call you up."</p>
<p>"Thank you," said Selwyn.</p>
<p>"You are welcome. What are you doing over there in Boots's
house?"</p>
<p>"Looking at the fire, Drina, and listening to the purring of
three fat tabby-cats."</p>
<p>"Oh! Mother and Eileen have gone somewhere. I haven't anything
to do for an hour. Can't you come around?"</p>
<p>"Why, yes, if you want me."</p>
<p>"Yes, I do. Of course I can't have Boots, and I prefer you next.
The children are fox-hunting, and it bores me. Will you come?"</p>
<p>"Yes. When?"</p>
<p>"Now. And would you mind bringing me a box of mint-paste? Mother
won't object. Besides, I'll tell her, anyway, after I've eaten
them."</p>
<p>"All right!" said Selwyn, laughing and hanging up the
receiver.</p>
<p>On his way to the Gerards' he bought a box of the confection
dear to Drina. But as he dropped the packet into his
overcoat-pocket, the memory of the past rose up suddenly, halting
him. He could not bear to go to the house without some little gift
for Eileen, and it was violets now as it was in the days that could
never dawn again&mdash;a great, fragrant bunch of them, which he
would leave for her after his brief play-hour with Drina was
ended.</p>
<p>The child was glad to see him, and expressed herself so, coming
across to the chair where he sat and leaning against him, one arm
on his shoulder.</p>
<p>"Do you know," she said, "that I miss you ever so much? Do you
know, also, that I am nearly fourteen, and that there is nobody in
this house near enough my age to be very companionable? I have
asked them to send me to school, and mother is considering it."</p>
<p>She leaned against his shoulder, curly head bent, thoughtfully
studying the turquoise ring on her slim finger. It was her first
ring. Nina had let Boots give it to her.</p>
<p>"What a tall girl you are growing into!" he said, encircling her
waist with one arm. "Your mother was like you at fourteen. . . .
Did she ever tell you how she first met your father? Well, I'll
tell you then. Your father was a schoolboy of fifteen, and one day
he saw the most wonderful little girl riding a polo pony out of the
Park. Her mother was riding with her. And he lost his head, and ran
after her until she rode into the Academy stables. And in he went,
headlong, after her, and found her dismounted and standing with her
mother; and he took off his hat, and he said to her mother: 'I've
run quite a long way to tell you who I am: I am Colonel Gerard's
son, Austin. Would you care to know me?'</p>
<p>"And he looked at the little girl, who had curls precisely like
yours, and the same little nose and mouth. And that little girl,
who is now your mother, said very simply: 'Won't you come home to
luncheon with us? May he, mother? He has run a very long way to be
polite to us.'</p>
<p>"And your mother's mother looked at the boy for a moment,
smiling, for he was the image of his father, who had been at school
with her. Then she said: 'Come to luncheon and tell me about your
father. Your father once came a thousand miles to see me, but I had
started the day before on my wedding-trip.'</p>
<hr style='width: 45%;' />
<p>"And that is how your father first met your mother, when she was
a little girl."</p>
<p>Drina laughed: "What a funny boy father was to run after a
strange girl on a polo pony! . . . Suppose&mdash;suppose he had not
seen her, and had not run after her. . . . Where would I be now,
Uncle Philip? . . . Could you please tell me?"</p>
<p>"Still aloft among the cherubim, sweetheart."</p>
<p>"But&mdash;whose uncle would you be? And who would Boots have
found for a comrade like me? . . . It's a good thing that father
ran after that polo pony. . . . Probably God arranged it. Do you
think so?"</p>
<p>"There is no harm in thinking it," he said, smiling.</p>
<p>"No; no harm. I've known for a long while that He was taking
care of Boots for me until I grow up. Meanwhile, I know some very
nice Harvard freshmen and two boys from St. Paul and five from
Groton. That helps, you know."</p>
<p>"Helps what?" asked Selwyn, vastly amused.</p>
<p>"To pass the time until I am eighteen," said the child serenely,
helping herself to another soft, pale-green chunk of the aromatic
paste. "Uncle Philip, mother has forbidden me&mdash;and I'll tell
her and take my punishment&mdash;but would you mind telling me how
you first met my Aunt Alixe?"</p>
<p>Selwyn's arm around her relaxed, then tightened.</p>
<p>"Why do you ask, dear?" he said very quietly.</p>
<p>"Because I was just wondering whether God arranged that,
too."</p>
<p>Selwyn looked at her a moment. "Yes," he said grimly; "nothing
happens by chance."</p>
<p>"Then, when God arranges such things, He does not always
consider our happiness."</p>
<p>"He gives us our chance, Drina."</p>
<p>"Oh! Did you have a chance? I heard mother say to Eileen that
you had never had a chance for happiness. I thought it was very
sad. I had gone into the clothes-press to play with my
dolls&mdash;you know I still do play with them&mdash;that is, I go
into some secret place and look at them at times when the children
are not around. So I was in there, sitting on the cedar-chest, and
I couldn't help hearing what they said."</p>
<p>She extracted another bonbon, bit into it, and shook her
head:</p>
<p>"And mother said to Eileen: 'Dearest, can't you learn to care
for him?' And Eileen&mdash;"</p>
<p>"Drina!" he interrupted sharply, "you must not repeat things you
overhear."</p>
<p>"Oh, I didn't hear anything more," said the child, "because I
remembered that I shouldn't listen, and I came out of the closet.
Mother was standing by the bed, and Eileen was lying on the bed
with her hands over her eyes; and I didn't know she had been crying
until I said: 'Please excuse me for listening,' and she sat up very
quickly, and I saw her face was flushed and her eyes wet. . . .
Isn't it possible for you to marry anybody, Uncle Philip?"</p>
<p>"No, Drina."</p>
<p>"Not even if Eileen would marry you?"</p>
<p>"No."</p>
<p>"Why?"</p>
<p>"You could not understand, dear. Even your mother cannot quite
understand. So we won't ever speak of it again, Drina."</p>
<p>The child balanced a bonbon between thumb and forefinger,
considering it very gravely.</p>
<p>"I know something that mother does not," she said. And as he
betrayed no curiosity:</p>
<p>"Eileen <i>is</i> in love. I heard her say so."</p>
<p>He straightened up sharply, turning to look at her.</p>
<p>"I was sleeping with her. I was still awake, and I heard her
say: 'I <i>do</i> love you&mdash;I <i>do</i> love you.' She said it
very softly, and I cuddled up, supposing she meant me. But she was
asleep."</p>
<p>"She certainly meant you," said Selwyn, forcing his stiffened
lips into a smile.</p>
<p>The child shook her head, looking down at the ring which she was
turning on her finger:</p>
<p>"No; she did not mean me."</p>
<p>"H-how do you know?"</p>
<p>"Because she said a man's name."</p>
<p>The silence lengthened; he sat, tilted a little forward, blank
gaze focussed on the snowy window; Drina, standing, leaned back
into the hollow of his arm, absently studying her ring.</p>
<p>A few moments later her music-teacher arrived, and Drina was
obliged to leave him.</p>
<p>"If you don't wait until I have finished my music," she said,
"you won't see mother and Eileen. They are coming to take me to the
riding-school at four o'clock."</p>
<p>He said that he couldn't stay that day; and when she had gone
away to the schoolroom he walked slowly to the window and looked
out across the snowy Park, where hundreds of children were
floundering about with gaily painted sleds. It was a pretty scene
in the sunshine; crimson sweaters and toboggan caps made vivid
spots of colour on the white expanse. Beyond, through the naked
trees, he could see the drive, and the sleighs with their brilliant
scarlet plumes and running-gear flashing in the sun. Overhead was
the splendid winter blue of the New York sky, in which, at a vast
height, sea-birds circled.</p>
<p>Meaning to go&mdash;for the house and its associations made him
restless&mdash;he picked up the box of violets and turned to ring
for a maid to take charge of them&mdash;and found himself
confronting Eileen, who, in her furs and gloves, was just entering
the room.</p>
<p>"I came up," she said; "they told me you were here, calling very
formally upon Drina, if you please. What with her monopoly of you
and Boots, there seems to be no chance for Nina and me."</p>
<p>They shook hands pleasantly; he offered her the box of violets,
and she thanked him and opened it, and, lifting the heavy, perfumed
bunch, bent her fresh young face to it. For a moment she stood
inhaling the scent, then stretched out her arm, offering their
fragrance to him.</p>
<p>"The first night I ever knew you, you sent me about a wagon-load
of violets," she said carelessly.</p>
<p>He nodded pleasantly; she tossed her muff on to the library
table, stripped off her gloves, and began to unhook her fur coat,
declining his aid with a quick shake of her head.</p>
<p>"It is easy&mdash;you see!"&mdash;as the sleeves slid from her
arms and the soft mass of fur fell into a chair. "And, by the way,
Drina said that you couldn't wait to see Nina," she continued,
turning to face a mirror and beginning to withdraw the jewelled
pins from her hat, "so you won't for a moment consider it necessary
to remain just because I wandered in&mdash;will you?"</p>
<p>He made no reply; she was still busy with her veil and hat and
her bright, glossy hair, the ends of which curled up at the
temples&mdash;a burnished frame for her cheeks which the cold had
delicately flushed to a wild-rost tint. Then, brushing back the
upcurled tendrils of her hair, she turned to confront him, faintly
smiling, brows lifted in silent repetition of her question.</p>
<p>"I will stay until Nina comes, if I may," he said slowly.</p>
<p>She seated herself. "You may," she said mockingly; "we don't
allow you in the house very often, so when you do come you may
remain until the entire family can congregate to inspect you." She
leaned back, looking at him; then look and manner changed, and she
bent impulsively forward:</p>
<p>"You don't look very well, Captain Selwyn; are you?"</p>
<p>"Perfectly. I"&mdash;he laughed&mdash;"I am growing old; that is
all."</p>
<p>"Do you say that to annoy me?" she asked, with a disdainful
shrug, "or to further impress me?"</p>
<p>He shook his head and touched the hair at his temples
significantly.</p>
<p>"Pooh!" she retorted. "It is becoming&mdash;is that what you
mean?"</p>
<p>"I hope it is. There's no reason why a man should not grow old
gracefully&mdash;"</p>
<p>"Captain Selwyn! But of course you only say it to bring out that
latent temper of mine. It's about the only thing that does it, too.
. . . And please don't plague me&mdash;if you've only a few moments
to stay. . . . It may amuse you to know that I, too, am exhibiting
signs of increasing infirmity; my temper, if you please, is not
what it once was."</p>
<p>"Worse than ever?" he asked in pretended astonishment.</p>
<p>"Far worse. It is vicious. Kit-Ki took a nap on a new
dinner-gown of mine, and I slapped her. And the other day Drina hid
in a clothes-press while Nina was discussing my private affairs,
and when the little imp emerged I could have shaken her. Oh, I am
certainly becoming infirm; so if you are, too, comfort yourself
with the knowledge that I am keeping pace with you through the
winter of our discontent."</p>
<p>At the mention of the incident of which Drina had already spoken
to him, Selwyn raised his head and looked at the girl curiously.
Then he laughed.</p>
<p>"I am wondering," he said in a bantering voice, "what secrets
Drina heard. I think I'd better ask her&mdash;"</p>
<p>"You had better not! Besides, <i>I</i> said nothing at all."</p>
<p>"But Nina did."</p>
<p>She nodded, lying there, arms raised, hands clasping the
upholstered wings of the big chair, and gazing at him out of
indolent, amused eyes.</p>
<p>"Would you like to know what Nina was saying to me?" she
asked.</p>
<p>"I'd rather hear what you said to her."</p>
<p>"I told you that I said nothing."</p>
<p>"Not a word?" he insisted.</p>
<p>"Not a word."</p>
<p>"Not even a sound?"</p>
<p>"N&mdash;well&mdash;I won't answer that."</p>
<p>"Oho!" he laughed. "So you did make some sort of inarticulate
reply! Were you laughing or weeping?"</p>
<p>"Perhaps I was yawning. How do you know?" she smiled.</p>
<p>After a moment he said, still curious: "<i>Why</i> were you
crying, Eileen?"</p>
<p>"Crying! I didn't say I was crying."</p>
<p>"I assume it."</p>
<p>"To prove or disprove that assumption," she said coolly, amused,
"let us hunt up a motive for a possible display of tears. What,
Captain Selwyn, have I to cry about? Is there anything in the world
that I lack? Anything that I desire and cannot have?"</p>
<p>"<i>Is</i> there?" he repeated.</p>
<p>"I asked you, Captain Selwyn."</p>
<p>"And, unable to reply," he said, "I ask you."</p>
<p>"And I," she retorted, "refuse to answer."</p>
<p>"Oho! So there <i>is</i>, then, something you lack? There
<i>is</i> a motive for possible tears?"</p>
<p>"You have not proven it," she said.</p>
<p>"You have not denied it."</p>
<p>She tipped back her head, linked her fingers under her chin, and
looked at him across the smooth curve of her cheeks.</p>
<p>"Well&mdash;yes," she admitted, "I was crying&mdash;if you
insist on knowing. Now that you have so cleverly driven me to admit
that, can you also force me to tell you <i>why</i> I was so
tearful?"</p>
<p>"Certainly," he said promptly; "it was something Nina said that
made you cry."</p>
<p>They both laughed.</p>
<p>"Oh, what a come-down!" she said teasingly. "You knew that
before. But can you force me to confess to you <i>what</i> Nina was
saying? If you can you are the cleverest cross-examiner in the
world, for I'd rather perish than tell you&mdash;"</p>
<p>"Oh," he said instantly, "then it was something about love!"</p>
<p>He had not meant to say it; he had spoken too quickly, and the
flush of surprise on the girl's face was matched by the colour
rising to his own temples. And, to retrieve the situation, he spoke
too quickly again&mdash;and too lightly.</p>
<p>"A girl would rather perish than admit that she is in love?" he
said, forcing a laugh. "That is rather a clever deduction, I think.
Unfortunately, however, I happen to know to the contrary, so all my
cleverness comes to nothing."</p>
<p>The surprise had faded from her face, but the colour remained;
and with it something else&mdash;something in the blue eyes which
he had never before encountered there&mdash;the faintest trace of
recoil, of shrinking away from him.</p>
<p>And she herself did not know it was there&mdash;did not quite
realise that she had been hurt. Surprise that he had chanced so
abruptly, so unerringly upon the truth had startled and confused
her; but that he had made free of the truth so lightly, so
carelessly, laughingly amused, left her without an answering
smile.</p>
<p>That it had been an accident&mdash;a chance surmise which
perhaps he himself did not credit&mdash;which he could not
believe&mdash;made it no easier for her. For the first time in his
life he had said something which left her unresponsive, with a
sense of bruised delicacy and of privacy invaded. A tinge of fear
of him crept in, too. She did not misconstrue what he had said
under privilege of a jest, but after what had once passed between
them she had not considered that love, even in the abstract, might
serve as a mocking text for any humour or jesting sermon from a man
who had asked her what he once asked&mdash;the man she had loved
enough to weep for when she had refused him only because she lacked
what he asked for. Knowing that she loved him in her own innocent
fashion, scarcely credulous that he ever could be dearer to her,
yet shyly wistful for whatever more the years might add to her
knowledge of a love so far immune from stress or doubt or the
mounting thrill of a deeper emotion, she had remained confidently
passive, warmly loyal, reverencing the mystery of the love he
offered, though she could not understand it or respond.</p>
<p>And now&mdash;now a chance turn; of a word&mdash;a trend to an
idle train of thought, jestingly followed!&mdash;and, without
warning, they had stumbled on a treasured memory, too frail, too
delicately fragile, to endure the shock.</p>
<p>And now fear crept in&mdash;fear that he had forgotten, had
changed. Else how could he have spoken so? . . . And the tempered
restraint of her quivered at the thought&mdash;all the serenity,
the confidence in life and in him began to waver. And her first
doubt crept in upon her.</p>
<p>She turned her expressionless face from him and, resting her
cheek against the velvet back of the chair, looked out into the
late afternoon sunshine.</p>
<p>All the long autumn without him, all her long, lonely, leisure
hours in the golden weather, his silence, his withdrawal into
himself, and his work, hitherto she had not misconstrued, though
often she confused herself in explaining it. Impatience of his
absence, too, had stimulated her to understand the temporary state
of things&mdash;to know that time away from him meant for her only
existence in suspense.</p>
<p>Very, very slowly, by degrees imperceptible, alone with memories
of him and of their summer's happiness already behind her, she had
learned that time added things to what she had once considered her
full capacity for affection.</p>
<p>Alone with her memories of him, at odd moments during the
day&mdash;often in the gay clamour and crush of the social
routine&mdash;or driving with Nina, or lying, wide-eyed, on her
pillow at night, she became conscious that time, little by little,
very gradually but very surely, was adding to her regard for him
frail, new, elusive elements that stole in to awake an unquiet
pulse or stir her heart into a sudden thrill, leaving it
fluttering, and a faint glow gradually spreading through her every
vein.</p>
<p>She was beginning to love him no longer in her own sweet
fashion, but in his; and she was vaguely aware of it, yet curiously
passive and content to put no question to herself whether it was
true or false. And how it might be with him she evaded asking
herself, too; only the quickening of breath and pulse questioned
the pure thoughts unvoiced; only the increasing impatience of her
suspense confirmed the answer which now, perhaps, she might give
him one day while the blessed world was young.</p>
<p>At the thought she moved uneasily, shifting her position in the
chair. Sunset, and the swift winter twilight, had tinted, then
dimmed, the light in the room. On the oak-beamed ceiling, across
the ivory rosettes, a single bar of red sunlight lay, broken by
rafter and plaster foliation. She watched it turn to rose, to
ashes. And, closing her eyes, she lay very still and motionless in
the gray shadows closing over all.</p>
<p>He had not yet spoken when again she lifted her eyes and saw him
sitting in the dusk, one arm resting across his knee, his body bent
slightly forward, his gaze vacant.</p>
<p>Into himself again!&mdash;silently companioned by the shadows of
old thoughts; far from her&mdash;farther than he had ever been. For
a while she lay there, watching him, scarcely breathing; then a
faint shiver of utter loneliness came over her&mdash;of desire for
his attention, his voice, his friendship, and the expression of it.
But he never moved; his eyes seemed dull and unseeing; his face
strangely gaunt to her, unfamiliar, hard. In the dim light he
seemed but the ghost of what she had known, of what she had thought
him&mdash;a phantom, growing vaguer, more unreal, slipping away
from her through the fading light. And the impulse to arouse
herself and him from the dim danger&mdash;to arrest the spell, to
break it, and seize what was their own in life overwhelmed her; and
she sat up, grasping the great arms of her chair, slender,
straight, white-faced in the gloom.</p>
<p>But he did not stir. Then unreasoning, instinctive fear confused
her, and she heard her own voice, sounding strangely in the
twilight:</p>
<p>"What has come between us, Captain Selwyn? What has happened to
us? Something is all wrong, and I&mdash;I ask you what it is,
because I don't know. Tell me."</p>
<p>He had lifted his head at her first word, hesitatingly, as
though dazed.</p>
<p>"Could you tell me?" she asked faintly.</p>
<p>"Tell you what, child?"</p>
<p>"Why you are so silent with me; what has crept in between us?
I"&mdash;the innocent courage sustaining her&mdash;"I have not
changed&mdash;except a little in&mdash;in the way you wished. Have
you?"</p>
<p>"No," he said in an altered voice.</p>
<p>"Then&mdash;what is it? I have been&mdash;you have left me so
much alone this winter&mdash;and I supposed I
understood&mdash;"</p>
<p>"My work," he said; but she scarcely knew the voice for his.</p>
<p>"I know; you have had no time. I know that; I ought to know it
by this time, for I have told myself often enough. And
yet&mdash;when we <i>are</i> together, it is&mdash;it has
been&mdash;different. Can you tell me why? Do you think me
changed?"</p>
<p>"You must not change," he said.</p>
<p>"No," she breathed, wondering, "I could not&mdash;except&mdash;a
little, as I told you."</p>
<p>"You must not change&mdash;not even that way!" he repeated in a
voice so low she could scarcely hear him&mdash;and believed she had
misunderstood him.</p>
<p>"I did not hear you," she said faintly. "What did you say to
me?"</p>
<p>"I cannot say it again."</p>
<p>She slowly shook her head, not comprehending, and for a while
sat silent, struggling with her own thoughts. Then, suddenly
instinct with the subtle fear which had driven her into speech:</p>
<p>"When I said&mdash;said that to you&mdash;last summer; when I
cried in the swinging seat there&mdash;because I could not answer
you&mdash;as I wished to&mdash;did <i>that</i> change you, Captain
Selwyn?"</p>
<p>"No."</p>
<p>"Then y-you are unchanged?"</p>
<p>"Yes, Eileen."</p>
<p>The first thrill of deep emotion struck through and through
her.</p>
<p>"Then&mdash;then <i>that</i> is not it," she faltered. "I was
afraid&mdash;I have sometimes wondered if it was. . . . I am very
glad, Captain Selwyn. . . . Will you wait a&mdash;a little
longer&mdash;for me to&mdash;to change?"</p>
<p>He stood up suddenly in the darkness, and she sprang to her
feet, breathless; for she had caught the low exclamation, and the
strange sound that stifled it in his throat.</p>
<p>"Tell me," she stammered, "w-what has happened. D-don't turn
away to the window; don't leave me all alone to endure
this&mdash;this <i>something</i> I have known was drawing you
away&mdash;I don't know where! What is it? Could you not tell
<i>me</i>, Captain Selwyn? I&mdash;I have been very frank with you;
I have been truthful&mdash;and loyal. I gave you, from the moment I
knew you, all of me there was to give. And&mdash;and if there is
more to give&mdash;now&mdash;it was yours when it came to me.</p>
<p>"Do you think I am too young to know what I am saying? Solitude
is a teacher. I&mdash;I am still a scholar, perhaps, but I think
that you could teach me what my drill-master, Solitude, could not .
. . if it&mdash;it is true you love me."</p>
<p>The mounting sea of passion swept him; he turned on her,
unsteadily, his hands clenched, not daring to touch her. Shame,
contrition, horror that the damage was already done, all were
forgotten; only the deadly grim duty of the moment held him
back.</p>
<p>"Dear," he said, "because I am unchanged&mdash;because I&mdash;I
love you so&mdash;help me!&mdash;and God help us both."</p>
<p>"Tell me," she said steadily, but it was fear that stilled her
voice. She laid one slim hand on the table, bearing down on the
points of her fingers until the nails whitened, but her head was
high and her eyes met his, straight, unwavering.</p>
<p>"I&mdash;I knew it," she said; "I understood there was
something. If it is trouble&mdash;and I see it is&mdash;bring it to
me. If I am the woman you took me for, give me my part in this. It
is the quickest way to my heart, Captain Selwyn."</p>
<p>But he had grown afraid, horribly afraid. All the cowardice in
him was in the ascendant. But that passed; watching his worn face,
she saw it passing. Fear clutched at her; for the first time in her
life she desired to go to him, hold fast to him, seeking in contact
the reassurance of his strength; but she only stood straighter, a
little paler, already half divining in the clairvoyance of her
young soul what lay still hidden.</p>
<p>"Do you ask a part in this?" he said at last.</p>
<p>"I ask it."</p>
<p>"Why?"</p>
<p>Her eyes wavered, then returned his gaze:</p>
<p>"For love of you," she said, as white as death.</p>
<p>He caught his breath sharply and straightened out, passing one
hand across his eyes. When she saw his face again in the dim light
it was ghastly.</p>
<p>"There was a woman," he said, "for whom I was once responsible."
He spoke wearily, head bent, resting the weight of one arm on the
table against which she leaned. "Do you understand?" he asked.</p>
<p>"Yes. You mean&mdash;Mrs. Ruthven."</p>
<p>"I mean&mdash;her. Afterward&mdash;when matters had
altered&mdash;I came&mdash;home."</p>
<p>He raised his head and looked about him in the darkness.</p>
<p>"Came home," he repeated, "no longer a man; the shadow of a man,
with no hope, no outlook, no right to hope."</p>
<p>He leaned heavily on the table, his arm rigid, looking down at
the floor as he spoke.</p>
<p>"No right to hope. Others told me that I still possessed that
right. I knew they were wrong; I do not mean that they persuaded
me&mdash;I persuaded myself that, after all, perhaps my right to
hope remained to me. I persuaded myself that I might be, after all,
the substance, not the shadow."</p>
<p>He looked up at her:</p>
<p>"And so I dared to love you."</p>
<p>She gazed at him, scarcely breathing.</p>
<p>"Then," he said, "came the awakening. My dream had ended."</p>
<p>She waited, the lace on her breast scarce stirring, so still she
stood, so pitifully still.</p>
<p>"Such responsibility cannot die while those live who undertook
it. I believed it until I desired to believe it no longer. But a
man's self-persuasion cannot alter such laws&mdash;nor can human
laws confirm or nullify them, nor can a great religion do more than
admit their truth, basing its creed upon such laws. . . . No man
can put asunder, no laws of man undo the burden. . . . And, to my
shame and disgrace, I have had to relearn this after offering you a
love I had no right to offer&mdash;a life which is not my own to
give."</p>
<p>He took one step toward her, and his voice fell so low that she
could just hear him:</p>
<p>"She has lost her mind, and the case is hopeless. Those to whom
the laws of the land have given care of her turned on her,
threatened her with disgrace. And when one friend of hers halted
this miserable conspiracy, her malady came swiftly upon her, and
suddenly she found herself helpless, penniless, abandoned, her mind
already clouded, and clouding faster! . . . Eileen, was there then
the shadow of a doubt as to the responsibility? Because a man's son
was named in the parable, does the lesson end there&mdash;and are
there no others as prodigal&mdash;no other bonds that hold as
inexorably as the bond of love?</p>
<p>"Men&mdash;a lawyer or two&mdash;a referee&mdash;decided to
remove a burden; but a higher court has replaced it."</p>
<p>He came and stood directly before her:</p>
<p>"I dare not utter one word of love to you; I dare not touch you.
What chance is there for such a man as I?"</p>
<p>"No chance&mdash;for us," she whispered. "Go!"</p>
<p>For a second he stood motionless, then, swaying slightly, turned
on his heel.</p>
<p>And long after he had left the house she still stood there, eyes
closed, colourless lips set, her slender body quivering, racked
with the first fierce grief of a woman's love for a man.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XII" id="CHAPTER_XII"></a>CHAPTER XII</h2>
<h3>HER WAY</h3>
<p>Neergard had already begun to make mistakes. The first was in
thinking that, among those whose only distinction was their wealth,
his own wealth permitted him the same insolence and ruthlessness
that so frequently characterised them.</p>
<p>Clever, vindictively patient, circumspect, and commercially
competent as he had been, his intelligence was not of a high order.
The intelligent never wilfully make enemies; Neergard made them
gratuitously, cynically kicking from under him the props he used in
mounting the breach, and which he fancied he no longer needed as a
scaffolding now that he had obtained a foothold on the outer wall.
Thus he had sneeringly dispensed with Gerald; thus he had
shouldered Fane and Harmon out of his way when they objected to the
purchase of Neergard's acreage adjoining the Siowitha preserve, and
its incorporation as an integral portion of the club tract; thus he
was preparing to rid himself of Ruthven for another reason. But he
was not yet quite ready to spurn Ruthven, because he wanted a
little more out of him&mdash;just enough to place himself on a
secure footing among those of the younger set where Ruthven, as
hack cotillon leader, was regarded by the young with wide-eyed
awe.</p>
<p>Why Neergard, who had forced himself into the Siowitha, ever
came to commit so gross a blunder as to dragoon, or even permit,
the club to acquire the acreage, the exploiting of which had
threatened their existence, is not very clear.</p>
<p>Once within the club he may have supposed himself perpetually
safe, not only because of his hold on Ruthven, but also because,
back of his unflagging persistence, back of his determination to
shoulder and push deep into the gilded, perfumed crush where
purse-strings and morals were loosened with every heave and twist
in the panting struggle around the raw gold altar&mdash;back of the
sordid past, back of all the resentment, and the sinister memory of
wrongs and grievances, still unbalanced, lay an enormous
vanity.</p>
<p>It was the vanity in him&mdash;even in the bitter
days&mdash;that throbbed with the agony of the bright world's
insolence; it was vanity which sustained him in better days where
he sat nursing in his crooked mind the crooked thoughts that
swarmed there. His desire for position and power was that; even his
yearning for corruption was but the desire for the satiation of a
vanity as monstrous as it was passionless. His to have what was
shared by those he envied&mdash;the power to pick and choose, to
ignore, to punish. His to receive, not to seek; to dispense, not to
stand waiting for his portion; his the freedom of the forbidden, of
everything beyond him, of all withheld, denied by this bright,
loose-robed, wanton-eyed goddess from whose invisible altar he had
caught a whiff of sacrificial odours, standing there through the
wintry years in the squalor and reek of things.</p>
<p>Now he had arrived among those outlying camps where
camp-followers and masters mingled. Certain card-rooms were open to
him, certain drawing-rooms, certain clubs. Through them he
shouldered, thrilled as he advanced deeper into the throng, fired
with the contact of the crush around him.</p>
<p>Already the familiarity of his appearance and his name seemed to
sanction his presence; two minor clubs, but good ones&mdash;in need
of dues&mdash;had strained at this social camel and swallowed him.
Card-rooms welcomed him&mdash;not the rooms once flung open
contemptuously for his plucking&mdash;but rooms where play was
fiercer, and where those who faced him expected battle to the
limit.</p>
<p>And they got it, for he no longer felt obliged to lose. And that
again was a mistake: he could not yet afford to win.</p>
<p>Thick in the chance and circumstance of the outer camp, heavily
involved financially and already a crushing financial force, meshed
in, or spinning in his turn the strands and counter-strands of
intrigue, with a dozen men already mortally offended and a woman or
two alarmed or half-contemptuously on guard, flattered, covetous,
or afraid, the limit of Neergard's intelligence was reached; his
present horizon ended the world for him because he could not
imagine anything beyond it; and that smirking vanity which had
'squired him so far, hat in hand, now plucked off its mask and
leered boldly about in the wake of its close-eyed master.</p>
<p>George Fane, unpleasantly involved in Block Copper, angry, but
not very much frightened, turned in casual good faith to Neergard
to ease matters until he could cover. And Neergard locked him in
the tighter and shouldered his way through Rosamund's drawing-room
to the sill of Sanxon Orchil's outer office, treading brutally on
Harmon's heels.</p>
<p>Harmon in disgust, wrath, and fear went to Craig; Craig to
Maxwell Hunt; Hunt wired Mottly; Mottly, cold and sleek in his
contempt, came from Palm Beach.</p>
<p>The cohesive power of caste is an unknown element to the
outsider.</p>
<p>That he had unwittingly and prematurely aroused some unsuspected
force on which he had not counted and of which he had no definite
knowledge was revealed to Neergard when he desired Rosamund to
obtain for him an invitation to the Orchils' ball.</p>
<p>It appeared that she could not do so&mdash;that even the
threatened tendency of Block Copper could not sharpen her wits to
devise a way for him. Very innocently she told him that Jack
Ruthven was leading the Chinese Cotillon with Mrs. Delmour-Carnes
from one end, Gerald Erroll with Gladys from the other&mdash;a hint
that a card ought to be easy enough to obtain in spite of the
strangely forgetful Orchils.</p>
<p>Long since he had fixed upon Gladys Orchil as the most suitable
silent partner for the unbuilt house of Neergard, unconcerned that
rumour was already sending her abroad for the double purpose of
getting rid of Gerald and of giving deserving aristocracy a look-in
at the fresh youth of her and her selling price.</p>
<p>Nothing, so far, had checked his progress; why should rumour?
Elbow and money had shoved him on and on, shoulder-deep where his
thin nose pointed, crowding aside and out of his way whatever was
made to be crowded out; and going around, hat off, whatever
remained arrogantly immovable.</p>
<p>So he had come, on various occasions, close to the unruffled
skirts of this young girl&mdash;not yet, however, in her own house.
But Sanxon Orchil had recently condescended to turn around in his
office chair and leave his amusing railroad combinations long
enough to divide with Neergard a quarter of a million copper
profits; and there was another turn to be expected when Neergard
gave the word.</p>
<p>Therefore, it puzzled and confused Neergard to be overlooked
where the gay world had been summoned with an accompanying blast
from the public press; therefore he had gone to Rosamund with the
curtest of hints; but he had remained, standing before her,
checked, not condescending to irritation, but mentally alert to a
new element of resistance which he had not expected&mdash;a new
force, palpable, unlooked for, unclassified as yet in his schedule
for his life's itinerary. That force was the cohesive power of
abstract caste in the presence of a foreign irritant threatening
its atomic disintegration. That foreign and irritating substance
was himself. But he had forgotten in his vanity that which in his
rawer shrewdness he should have remembered. Eternal vigilance was
the price; not the cancelled vouchers of the servitude of dead
years and the half-servile challenge of the strange new days when
his vanity had dared him to live.</p>
<hr style='width: 45%;' />
<p>Rosamund, smoothly groomed, golden-headed, and smiling, rose as
Neergard moved slowly forward to take his leave.</p>
<p>"So stupid of them to have overlooked you," she said; "and I
should have thought Gladys would have
remembered&mdash;unless&mdash;"</p>
<p>His close-set eyes focussed so near her own that she stopped,
involuntarily occupied with the unusual phenomenon.</p>
<p>"Unless what?" he asked.</p>
<p>She was all laughing polished surface again. "Unless Gladys's
intellect, which has only room for one idea at a time, is already
fully occupied."</p>
<p>"With what?" he demanded.</p>
<p>"Oh, with that Gerald boy "&mdash;she shrugged
indulgently&mdash;"perhaps with her pretty American Grace and the
outlook for the Insular invasion."</p>
<p>Neergard's apple face was dull and mottled, and on the thin
bridge of his nose the sweat glistened. He did not know what she
meant; and she knew he did not.</p>
<p>As he turned to go she paced him a step or two across the
rose-and-gold reception-room, hands linked behind her back, bending
forward slightly as she moved beside him.</p>
<p>"Gerald, poor lad, is to be disciplined," she observed. "The
prettiest of American duchesses takes her over next spring; and
Heaven knows the household cavalry needs green forage . . .
Besides, even Jack Ruthven may stand the chance they say he stands
if it is true he has made up his mind to sue for his divorce."</p>
<p>Neergard wheeled on her; the sweat on his nose had become a
bright bead.</p>
<p>"Where did you hear that?" he asked.</p>
<p>"What? About Jack Ruthven?" Her smooth shoulders fluttered her
answer.</p>
<p>"You mean it's talked about?" he insisted.</p>
<p>"In some sets," she said with an indifference which coolly
excluded the probability that he could have been in any position to
hear what was discussed in those sets.</p>
<p>Again he felt the check of something intangible but real; and
the vanity in him, flicked on the raw, peered out at her from his
close-set eyes. For a moment he measured her from the edge of her
skirt to her golden head, insolently.</p>
<p>"You might remind your husband," he said, "that I'd rather like
to have a card to the Orchil affair."</p>
<p>"There is no use in speaking to George," she replied
regretfully, shaking her head.</p>
<p>"Try it," returned Neergard with the hint of a snarl; and he
took his leave, and his hat from the man in waiting, who looked
after him with the slightest twitching of his shaven upper lip. For
the lifting of an eyebrow in the drawing-rooms becomes warrant for
a tip that runs very swiftly below stairs.</p>
<p>That afternoon, alone in his office, Neergard remembered Gerald.
And for the first time he understood the mistake of making an enemy
out of what he had known only as a friendly fool.</p>
<p>But it was a detail, after all&mdash;merely a slight error in
assuming too early an arrogance he could have afforded to wait for.
He had waited a long, long while for some things.</p>
<p>As for Fane, he had him locked up with his short account. No
doubt he'd hear from the Orchils through the Fanes. However, to
clinch the matter, he thought he might as well stop in to see
Ruthven. A plain word or two to Ruthven indicating his own
wishes&mdash;perhaps outlining his policy concerning the future
house of Neergard&mdash;might as well be delivered now as
later.</p>
<p>So that afternoon he took a hansom at Broad and Wall streets and
rolled smoothly uptown, not seriously concerned, but willing to
have a brief understanding with Ruthven on one or two subjects.</p>
<p>As his cab drove up to the intricately ornamental little house
of gray stone, a big touring limousine wheeled out from the curb,
and he caught sight of Sanxon Orchil and Phoenix Mottly inside,
evidently just leaving Ruthven.</p>
<p>His smiling and very cordial bow was returned coolly by Orchil,
and apparently not observed at all by Mottly. He sat a second in
his cab, motionless, the obsequious smile still stencilled on his
flushed face; then the flush darkened; he got out of his cab and,
bidding the man wait, rang at the house of Ruthven.</p>
<p>Admitted, it was a long while before he was asked to mount the
carved stairway of stone. And when he did, on every step, hand on
the bronze rail, he had the same curious sense of occult resistance
to his physical progress; the same instinct of a new element
arising into the scheme of things the properties of which he felt a
sudden fierce desire to test and comprehend.</p>
<p>Ruthven in a lounging suit of lilac silk, sashed in with
flexible silver, stood with his back to the door as Neergard was
announced; and even after he was announced Ruthven took his time to
turn and stare and nod with a deliberate negligence that accented
the affront.</p>
<p>Neergard sat down; Ruthven gazed out of the window, then, soft
thumbs hooked in his sash, turned leisurely in impudent
interrogation.</p>
<p>"What the hell is the matter with you?" asked Neergard, for the
subtle something he had been encountering all day had suddenly
seemed to wall him out of all he had conquered, forcing him back
into the simpler sordid territory where ways and modes of speech
were more familiar to him&mdash;where the spontaneous crudity of
expression belonged among the husks of all he had supposed
discarded for ever.</p>
<p>"Really," observed Ruthven, staring at the seated man, "I
scarcely understand your remark."</p>
<p>"Well, you'll understand it perhaps when I choose to explain
it," said Neergard. "I see there's some trouble somewhere. What is
it? What's the matter with Orchil, and that hatchet-faced
beagle-pup, Mottly? <i>Is</i> there anything the matter, Jack?"</p>
<p>"Nothing important," said Ruthven with an intonation which
troubled Neergard. "Did you come here to&mdash;ah&mdash;ask
anything of me? Very glad to do anything, I'm sure."</p>
<p>"Are you? Well, then, I want a card to the Orchils'."</p>
<p>Ruthven raised his brows slightly; and Neergard waited, then
repeated his demand.</p>
<p>Ruthven began to explain, rather languidly, that it was
impossible; but&mdash;"I want it," insisted the other doggedly.</p>
<p>"I can't be of any service to you in this instance."</p>
<p>"Oh, yes, I think you can. I tell you I want that card. Do you
understand plain speech?"</p>
<p>"Ya-as," drawled Ruthven, seating himself a trifle wearily among
his cushions, "but yours is so&mdash;ah&mdash;very
plain&mdash;quite elemental, you know. You ask for a bid to the
Orchils'; I tell you quite seriously I can't secure one for
you."</p>
<p>"You'd better think it over," said Neergard menacingly.</p>
<p>"Awfully sorry."</p>
<p>"You mean you won't?"</p>
<p>"Ah&mdash;quite so."</p>
<p>Neergard's thin nose grew white and tremulous:</p>
<p>"Why?"</p>
<p>"You insist?" in mildly bored deprecation.</p>
<p>"Yes, I insist. Why can't you&mdash;or why won't you?"</p>
<p>"Well, if you really insist, they&mdash;ah&mdash;don't want you,
Neergard."</p>
<p>"Who&mdash;why&mdash;how do you happen to know that they don't?
Is this some petty spite of that young cub, Gerald? Or"&mdash;and
he almost looked at Ruthven&mdash;"is this some childish whim of
yours?"</p>
<p>"Oh, really now&mdash;"</p>
<p>"Yes, really now," sneered Neergard, "you'd better tell me. And
you'd better understand, now, once for all, just exactly what I've
outlined for myself&mdash;so you can steer clear of the territory I
operate in." He clasped his blunt fingers and leaned forward,
projecting his whole body, thick legs curled under; but his
close-set eyes still looked past Ruthven.</p>
<p>"I need a little backing," he said, "but I can get along without
it. And what I'm going to do is to marry Miss Orchil. Now you know;
now you understand. I don't care a damn about the Erroll boy; and I
think I'll discount right now any intentions of any married man to
bother Miss Orchil after some Dakota decree frees him from the
woman whom he's driven into an asylum."</p>
<p>Ruthven looked at him curiously:</p>
<p>"So that is discounted, is it?"</p>
<p>"I think so," nodded Neergard. "I don't think that man will try
to obtain a divorce until I say the word."</p>
<p>"Oh! Why not?"</p>
<p>"Because of my knowledge concerning that man's crooked methods
in obtaining for me certain options that meant ruin to his own
country club," said Neergard coolly.</p>
<p>"I see. How extraordinary! But the club has bought in all that
land, hasn't it?"</p>
<p>"Yes&mdash;but the stench of your treachery remains, my
friend."</p>
<p>"Not treachery, only temptation," observed Ruthven blandly.
"I've talked it all over with Orchil and Mottly&mdash;"</p>
<p>"You&mdash;<i>what</i>!" gasped Neergard.</p>
<p>"Talked about it," repeated Ruthven, hard face guileless, and
raising his eyebrows&mdash;a dreadful caricature of youth in the
misleading smoothness of the minutely shaven face; "I told Orchil
what you persuaded me to do&mdash;"</p>
<p>"You&mdash;you damned&mdash;"</p>
<p>"Not at all, not at all!" protested Ruthven, languidly settling
himself once more among the cushions. "And by the way," he added,
"there's a law&mdash;by-law&mdash;something or other, that I
understand may interest you"&mdash;he looked up at Neergard, who
had sunk back in his chair&mdash;"about unpaid
assessments&mdash;"</p>
<p>Neergard now for the first time was looking directly at him.</p>
<p>"Unpaid assessments," repeated Ruthven. "It's a, detail&mdash;a
law&mdash;never enforced unless we&mdash;ah&mdash;find it
convenient to rid ourselves of a member. It's rather useful, you
see, in such a case&mdash;a technical pretext, you know. . . . I
forget the exact phrasing; something about' ceases to retain his
membership, and such shares of stock as he may own in the said club
shall be appraised and delivered to the treasurer upon receipt of
the value'&mdash;or something like that."</p>
<p>Still Neergard looked at him, hunched up in his chair, chin sunk
on his chest.</p>
<p>"Thought it just as well to mention it," said Ruthven blandly,
"as they've seen fit to take advantage of
the&mdash;ah&mdash;opportunity&mdash;under legal advice. You'll
hear from the secretary, I fancy&mdash;Mottly, you know. . . .
<i>Is</i> there anything more, Neergard?"</p>
<p>Neergard scarcely heard him. He had listened, mechanically, when
told in as many words that he had been read out of the Siowitha
Club; he understood that he stood alone, discarded, disgraced, with
a certain small coterie of wealthy men implacably hostile to him.
But it was not that which occupied him: he was face to face with
the new element of which he had known nothing&mdash;the subtle,
occult resistance to himself and his personality, all that he
represented, embodied, stood for, hoped for.</p>
<p>And for the first time he realised that among the ruthless, no
ruthlessness was permitted him; among the reckless, circumspection
had been required of him; no arrogance, no insolence had been
permitted him among the arrogant and insolent; for, when such as he
turned threateningly upon one of those belonging to that elemental
matrix of which he dared suppose himself an integral part, he found
that he was mistaken. Danger to one from such as he endangered
their common caste&mdash;such as it was. And, silently, subtly, all
through that portion of the social fabric, he became slowly
sensible of resistance&mdash;resistance everywhere, from every
quarter.</p>
<p>Now, hunched up there in his chair, he began to understand. If
Ruthven had been a blackguard&mdash;it was not for him to punish
him&mdash;no, not even threaten to expose him. His own caste would
take care of that; his own sort would manage such affairs.
Meanwhile Neergard had presumed to annoy them, and the society into
which he had forced himself and which he had digestively affected,
was now, squid-like, slowly turning itself inside out to expel him
as a foreign substance from which such unimportant nutrition as he
had afforded had been completely extracted.</p>
<p>He looked at Ruthven, scarcely seeing him. Finally he gathered
his thick legs under to support him as he rose, stupidly, looking
about for his hat.</p>
<p>Ruthven rang for a servant; when he came Neergard followed him
without a word, small eyes vacant, the moisture powdering the ridge
of his nose, his red blunt hands dangling as he walked. Behind him
a lackey laughed.</p>
<hr style='width: 45%;' />
<p>In due time Neergard, who still spent his penny on a morning
paper, read about the Orchil ball. There were three columns and
several pictures. He read all there was to read about&mdash;the
sickeningly minute details of jewels and costumes, the sorts of
stuffs served at supper, the cotillon, the favours&mdash;then,
turning back, he read about the dozen-odd separate hostesses who
had entertained the various coteries and sets at separate dinners
before the ball&mdash;read every item, every name, to the last
imbecile period.</p>
<p>Then he rose wearily, and started downtown to see what his
lawyers could do toward reinstating him in a club that had expelled
him&mdash;to find out if there remained the slightest trace of a
chance in the matter. But even as he went he knew there could be
none. The squid had had its will with him, not he with the squid;
and within him rose again all the old hatred and fear of these
people from whom he had desired to extract full payment for the
black days of need he had endured, for the want, the squalor, the
starvation he had passed through.</p>
<p>But the reckoning left him where he had started&mdash;save for
the money they had used when he forced it on them&mdash;not
thanking him.</p>
<p>So he went to his lawyers&mdash;every day for a while, then
every week, then, toward the end of winter, less often, for he had
less time now, and there was a new pressure which he was beginning
to feel vaguely hostile to him in his business
enterprises&mdash;hitches in the negotiations of loans, delays,
perhaps accidental, but annoying; changes of policy in certain
firms who no longer cared to consider acreage as investment; and a
curiously veiled antagonism to him in a certain railroad, the
reorganisation of which he had dared once to aspire to.</p>
<p>And one day, sitting alone in his office, a clerk brought him a
morning paper with one column marked in a big blue-pencilled
oval.</p>
<p>It was only about a boy and a girl who had run away and married
because they happened to be in love, although their parents had
prepared other plans for their separate disposal. The column was a
full one, the heading in big type&mdash;a good deal of pother about
a boy and a girl, after all, particularly as it appeared that their
respective families had determined to make the best of it. Besides,
the girl's parents had other daughters growing up; and the
prettiest of American duchesses would no doubt remain amiable. As
for the household cavalry, probably some of them were badly in need
of forage, but that thin red line could hold out until the younger
sisters shed pinafores. So, after all, in spite of double leads and
the full column, the runaways could continue their impromptu
honeymoon without fear of parents, duchess, or a rescue charge from
that thin, red, and impecunious line.</p>
<hr style='width: 45%;' />
<p>It took Neergard all day to read that column before he folded it
away and pigeonholed it among a lot of dusty
documents&mdash;uncollected claims, a memorandum of a deal with
Ruthven, a note from an actress, and the papers in his case against
the Siowitha Club which would never come to a suit&mdash;he knew it
now&mdash;never amount to anything. So among these archives of dead
desires, dead hopes, and of vengeance deferred <i>sine die</i>, he
laid away the soiled newspaper.</p>
<p>Then he went home, very tired with a mental lassitude that
depressed him and left him drowsy in his great arm-chair before the
grate&mdash;too drowsy and apathetic to examine the letters and
documents laid out for him by his secretary, although one of them
seemed to be important&mdash;something about alienation of
affections, something about a yacht and Mrs. Ruthven, and a heavy
suit to be brought unless other settlement was suggested as a balm
to Mr. Ruthven.</p>
<p>To dress for dinner was an effort&mdash;a purely mechanical
operation which was only partly successful, although his man aided
him. But he was too tired to continue the effort; and at last it
was his man alone who disembarrassed him of his heavy clothing and
who laid him among the bedclothes, where he sank back, relaxed,
breathing loudly in the dreadful depressed stupor of utter physical
and neurotic prostration.</p>
<p>Meaningless to him the hurriedly intrusive attorneys&mdash;his
own and Ruthven's&mdash;who forced their way in that night&mdash;or
was it the next, or months later? A weight like the weight of death
lay on him, mind and body. If he comprehended what threatened, what
was coming, he did not care. The world passed on, leaving him lying
there, nerveless, exhausted, a derelict on a sea too stormy for
such as he&mdash;a wreck that might have sailed safely in narrower
waters.</p>
<p>And some day he'd be patched up and set afloat once more to
cruise and operate and have his being in the safer and smaller
seas; some day, when the nerve crash had subsided and the slow,
wounded mind came back to itself, and its petty functions were once
more resumed&mdash;its envious scheming, its covetous capability,
its vicious achievement. For with him achievement could embody only
the meaner imitations of the sheer colossal <i>coups</i> by which
the great financiers gutted a nation with kid-gloved fingers, and
changed their gloves after the operation so that no blood might
stick to Peter's pence or smear the corner-stones of those vast and
shadowy institutions upreared in restitution&mdash;black
silhouettes against the infernal sunset of lives that end in the
shadowy death of souls.</p>
<hr style='width: 45%;' />
<p>Even before Neergard's illness Ruthven's domestic and financial
affairs were in a villainous mess. Rid of Neergard, he had meant to
deal him a crashing blow at the breakaway which would settle him
for ever and incidentally bring to a crisis his own status in
regard to his wife.</p>
<p>Whether or not his wife was mentally competent he did not know;
he did not know anything about her. But he meant to. Selwyn's
threat, still fairly fresh in his memory, had given him no definite
idea of Alixe, her whereabouts, her future plans, and whether or
not her mental condition was supposed to be permanently impaired or
otherwise.</p>
<p>That she had been, and probably now was, under Selwyn's
protection he believed; what she and Selwyn intended to do he did
not know. But he wanted to know; he dared not ask
Selwyn&mdash;dared not, because he was horribly afraid of Selwyn;
dared not yet make a legal issue of their relations, of her
sequestration, or of her probable continued infirmity, because of
his physical fear of the man.</p>
<p>But there was&mdash;or he thought that there had been&mdash;one
way to begin the matter, because the matter must sooner or later be
begun: and that was to pretend to assume Neergard responsible; and,
on the strength of his wife's summer sojourn aboard the
<i>Niobrara</i>, turn on Neergard and demand a reckoning which he
believed Selwyn would never hear of, because he did not suppose
Neergard dared defend the suit, and would sooner or later
compromise. Which would give him what he wanted to begin with,
money, and the entering wedge against the wife he meant to be rid
of in one way or another, even if he had to swear out a warrant
against Selwyn before he demanded a commission to investigate her
mental condition.</p>
<p>Ruthven was too deadly afraid of Selwyn to begin suit at that
stage of the proceedings. All he could do was to start, through his
attorneys, a search for his wife, and meanwhile try to formulate
some sort of definite plan in regard to Gladys Orchil; for if that
featherbrained youngster went abroad in the spring he meant to
follow her and not only have the Atlantic between him and Selwyn
when he began final suit for freedom, but also be in a position to
ride off any of the needy household cavalry who might come
caracolling and cavorting too close to the young girl he had
selected to rehabilitate the name, fortune, and house of
Ruthven.</p>
<p>This, in brief, was Ruthven's general scheme of campaign; and
the entire affair had taken some sort of shape, and was slowly
beginning to move, when Neergard's illness came as an absolute
check, just as the first papers were about to be served on him.</p>
<p>There was nothing to do but wait until Neergard got well,
because his attorneys simply scoffed at any suggestion of
settlement <i>ex curia</i>, and Ruthven didn't want a suit
involving his wife's name while he and Selwyn were in the same
hemisphere.</p>
<p>But he could still continue an unobtrusive search for the
whereabouts of his wife, which he did. And the chances were that
his attorneys would find her without great difficulty, because
Selwyn had not the slightest suspicion that he was being
followed.</p>
<hr style='width: 45%;' />
<p>In these days Selwyn's life was methodical and colourless in its
routine to the verge of dreariness.</p>
<p>When he was not at the Government proving grounds on Sandy Hook
he remained in his room at Lansing's, doggedly forcing himself into
the only alternate occupation sufficient to dull the sadness of his
mind&mdash;the preparation of a history of British military
organisation in India, and its possible application to present
conditions in the Philippines.</p>
<p>He had given up going out&mdash;made no further pretense; and
Boots let him alone.</p>
<p>Once a week he called at the Gerards', spending most of his time
while there with the children. Sometimes he saw Nina and Eileen,
usually just returned or about to depart for some function; and his
visit, as a rule, ended with a cup of tea alone with Austin, and a
quiet cigar in the library, where Kit-Ki sat, paws folded under,
approving of the fireside warmth in a pleasureable monotone.</p>
<p>On such evenings, late, if Nina and Eileen had gone to a dance,
or to the opera with Boots, Austin, ruddy with well-being and
shamelessly slippered, stretched luxuriously in the fire warmth,
lazily discussing what was nearest to him&mdash;his children and
wife, and the material comfort which continued to attend him with
the blessing of that heaven which seems so largely occupied in
fulfilling the desires of the good for their own commercial
prosperity.</p>
<p>Too, he had begun to show a peculiar pride in the commercial
development of Gerald, speaking often of his gratifying application
to business, the stability of his modest position, the friends he
was making among men of substance, their regard for him.</p>
<p>"Not that the boy is doing much of a business yet," he would say
with a tolerant shrug of his big fleshy shoulders, "but he's laying
the foundation for success&mdash;a good, upright, solid
foundation&mdash;with the doubtful scheming of Neergard left
out"&mdash;at that time Neergard had not yet gone to pieces,
physically&mdash;"and I expect to aid him when aid is required, and
to extend to him, judiciously, such assistance, from time to time,
as I think he may require. . . . There's one thing&mdash;"</p>
<p>Austin puffed once or twice at his cigar and frowned; and
Selwyn, absently watching the dying embers on the hearth, waited in
silence.</p>
<p>"One thing," repeated Austin, reaching for the tongs and laying
a log of white birch across the coals; "and that is Gerald's
fondness for pretty girls. . . . Not that it isn't all right, too,
but I hope he isn't going to involve himself&mdash;hang a millstone
around his neck before he can see his way clear to some promise of
a permanent income based on&mdash;"</p>
<p>"Pooh!" said Selwyn.</p>
<p>"What's that?" demanded Austin, turning red.</p>
<p>Selwyn laughed. "What did you have when you married my
sister?"</p>
<p>Austin, still red and dignified, said:</p>
<p>"Your sister is a very remarkable woman&mdash;extremely unusual.
I had the good sense to see that the first time I ever met
her."</p>
<p>"Gerald will see the same thing when his time comes," said
Selwyn quietly. "Don't worry, Austin; he's sound at the core."</p>
<p>Austin considered his cigar-end, turning it round and round.
"There's good stock in the boy; I always knew it&mdash;even when he
acted like a yellow pup. You see, Phil, that my treatment of him
was the proper treatment. I was right in refusing to mollycoddle
him or put up with any of his callow, unbaked impudence. You know
yourself that you wanted me to let up on him&mdash;make all kinds
of excuses. Why, man, if I had given him an inch leeway he'd have
been up to his ears in debt. But I was firm. He saw I'd stand no
fooling. He didn't dare contract debts which he couldn't pay. So
now, Phil, you can appreciate the results of my attitude toward
him."</p>
<p>"I can, indeed," said Selwyn thoughtfully.</p>
<p>"I think I've made a man of him," persisted Austin.</p>
<p>"He's certainly a manly fellow," nodded Selwyn.</p>
<p>"You admit it?"</p>
<p>"Certainly, Austin."</p>
<p>"Well, I'm glad of it. You thought me harsh&mdash;oh, I know you
did!&mdash;but I don't blame you. I knew what I was about. Why,
Phil, if I hadn't taken the firm stand I took that boy would have
been running to Nina and Eileen&mdash;he did go to his sister once,
but he never dared try it again!&mdash;and he'd probably have
borrowed money of Neergard and&mdash;by Jove! he might even have
come to you to get him out of his scrapes!"</p>
<p>"Oh, scarcely that," protested Selwyn with grave humour.</p>
<p>"That's all you know about it," nodded Austin, wise-eyed,
smoking steadily. "And all I have to say is that it's fortunate for
everybody that I stood my ground when he came around looking for
trouble. For you're just the sort of a man, Phil, who'd be likely
to strip yourself if that young cub came howling for somebody to
pay his debts of honour. Admit it, now; you know you are."</p>
<p>But Selwyn only smiled and looked into the fire.</p>
<p>After a few moments' silence Austin said curiously: "You're a
frugal bird. You used to be fastidious. Do you know that coat of
yours is nearly the limit?"</p>
<p>"Nonsense," said Selwyn, colouring.</p>
<p>"It is. . . . What do you do with your money? Invest it, of
course; but you ought to let me place it. You never spend any; you
should have a decent little sum tucked away by this time. Do your
Chaosite experiments cost anything now?"</p>
<p>"No; the Government is conducting them."</p>
<p>"Good business. What does the bally Government think of the
powder, now?"</p>
<p>"I can't tell yet," said Selwyn listlessly. "There's a plate due
to arrive to-morrow; it represents a section of the side armour of
one of the new 22,000-ton battleships. . . . I hope to crack
it."</p>
<p>"Oh!&mdash;with a bursting charge?"</p>
<p>Selwyn nodded, and rested his head on his hand.</p>
<p>A little later Austin cast the remains of his cigar from him,
straightened up, yawned, patted his waistcoat, and looked wisely at
the cat.</p>
<p>"I'm going to bed," he announced. "Boots is to bring back Nina
and Eileen. . . . You don't mind, do you, Phil? I've a busy day
to-morrow. . . . There's Scotch over there&mdash;you know where
things are. Ring if you have a sudden desire for anything funny
like peacock feathers on toast. There's cold grouse somewhere
underground if you're going to be an owl. . . . And don't feed that
cat on the rugs. . . . Good-night."</p>
<p>"Good-night," nodded Selwyn, relighting his cigar.</p>
<p>He had no intention of remaining very long; he supposed that his
sister and Eileen would be out late, wherever they were, and he
merely meant to dream a bit longer before going back to bed.</p>
<p>He had been smoking for half an hour perhaps, lying deep in his
chair, worn features dully illuminated by the sinking fire; and he
was thinking about going&mdash;had again relighted his partly
consumed cigar to help him with its fragrant companionship on his
dark route homeward, when he heard a footfall on the landing, and
turned to catch a glimpse of Gerald in overcoat and hat, moving
silently toward the stairs.</p>
<p>"Hello, old fellow!" he said, surprised. "I didn't know you were
in the house."</p>
<p>The boy hesitated, turned, placed something just outside the
doorway, and came quickly into the room.</p>
<p>"Philip!" he said with a curious, excited laugh, "I want to ask
you something. I never yet came to you without asking something
and&mdash;you never have failed me. Would you tell me now what I
had better do?"</p>
<p>"Certainly," said Selwyn, surprised and smiling; "ask me, old
fellow. You're not eloping with some nice girl, are you?"</p>
<p>"Yes," said Gerald, calm in his excitement, "I am."</p>
<p>"What?" repeated Selwyn gravely; "what did you say?</p>
<p>"You guessed it. I came home and dressed and I'm going back to
the Craigs' to marry a girl whose mother and father won't let me
have her."</p>
<p>"Sit down, Gerald," said Selwyn, removing the cigar from his
lips; but:</p>
<p>"I haven't time," said the boy. "I simply want to know what
you'd do if you loved a girl whose mother means to send her to
London to get rid of me and marry her to that yawning Elliscombe
fellow who was over here. . . . What would you do? She's too young
to stand much of a siege in London&mdash;some Englishman will get
her if he persists&mdash;and I mean to make her love me."</p>
<p>"Oh! Doesn't she?"</p>
<p>"Y-es. . . . You know how young girls are. Yes, she
does&mdash;now. But a year or two with that crowd&mdash;and the
duchess being good to her, and Elliscombe yawning and looking like
a sleepy Lohengrin or some damned prince in his Horse Guards'
helmet!&mdash;Selwyn, I can see the end of it. She can't stand it;
she's too young not to get over it. . . . So, what would you
do?"</p>
<p>"Who is she, Gerald?"</p>
<p>"I won't tell you."</p>
<p>"Oh! . . . Of course she's the right sort?"</p>
<p>"Perfectly."</p>
<p>"Young?"</p>
<p>"Very. Out last season."</p>
<p>Selwyn rose and began to pace the floor; Kit-Ki, disturbed,
looked up, then resumed her purring.</p>
<p>"There's nothing dishonourable in this, of course," said Selwyn,
halting short.</p>
<p>"No," said the boy. "I went to her mother and asked for her, and
was sent about my business. Then I went to her father. You know
him. He was decent, bland, evasive, but decent. Said his daughter
needed a couple of seasons in London; hinted of some prior
attachment. Which is rot; because she loves me&mdash;she admits it.
Well, I said to him, 'I'm going to marry Gladys'; and he laughed
and tried to look at his moustache; and after a while he asked to
be excused. I took the count. Then I saw Gladys at the Craigs', and
I said, 'Gladys, if you'll give up the whole blooming heiress
business and come with me, I'll make you the happiest girl in
Manhattan.' And she looked me straight in the eyes and said, 'I'd
rather grow up with you than grow old forgetting you.'"</p>
<p>"Did she say that?" asked Selwyn.</p>
<p>"She said,'We've the greatest chance in the world, Gerald, to
make something of each other. Is it a good risk?' And I said, 'It
is the best risk in the world if you love me.' And she said, 'I do,
dearly; I'll take my chance.' And that's how it stands, Philip. . .
. She's at the Craigs'&mdash;a suit-case and travelling-gown
upstairs. Suddy Gray and Betty Craig are standing for it,
and"&mdash;with a flush&mdash;"there's a little church, you
know&mdash;"</p>
<p>"Around the corner. I know. Did you telephone?"</p>
<p>"Yes."</p>
<p>There was a pause; the older man dropped his hands into his
pockets and stepped quietly in front of Gerald; and for a full
minute they looked squarely at one another, unwinking.</p>
<p>"Well?" asked Gerald, almost tremulously. "Can't you say, 'Go
ahead!'?"</p>
<p>"Don't ask me."</p>
<p>"No, I won't," said the boy simply. "A man doesn't ask about
such matters; he does them. . . . Tell Austin and Nina. . . . And
give this note to Eileen." He opened a portfolio and laid an
envelope in Selwyn's hands. "And&mdash;by George!&mdash;I almost
forgot! Here"&mdash;and he laid a check across the note in Selwyn's
hand&mdash;"here's the balance of what you've advanced me. Thank
God, I've made it good, every cent. But the debt is only the
deeper. . . . Good-bye, Philip."</p>
<p>Selwyn held the boy's hand a moment. Once or twice Gerald
thought he meant to speak, and waited, but when he became aware of
the check thrust back at him he forced it on Selwyn again,
laughing:</p>
<p>"No! no! If I did not stand clear and free in my shoes do you
think I'd dare do what I'm doing? Do you suppose I'd ask a girl to
face with me a world in which I owed a penny? Do you suppose I'm
afraid of that world?&mdash;or of a soul in it? Do you suppose I
can't take a living out of it?"</p>
<p>Suddenly Selwyn crushed the boy's hand.</p>
<p>"Then take it!&mdash;and her, too!" he said between his teeth;
and turned on his heel, resting his arms on the mantel and his head
face downward between them.</p>
<p>So Gerald went away in the pride and excitement of buoyant youth
to take love as he found it and where he found it&mdash;though he
had found it only as the green bud of promise which unfolds, not to
the lover, but to love. And the boy was only one of many on whom
the victory might have fallen; but such a man becomes the only man
when he takes what he finds for himself&mdash;green bud, half
blown, or open to its own deep fragrant heart. To him that hath
shall be given, and much forgiven. For it is the law of the strong
and the prophets: and a little should be left to that Destiny which
the devout revere under a gentler name.</p>
<hr style='width: 45%;' />
<p>The affair made a splash in the social puddle, and the commotion
spread outside of it. Inside the nine-and-seventy cackled; outside
similar gallinaceous sounds. Neergard pored all day over the
blue-pencilled column, and went home, stunned; the social sheet
which is taken below stairs and read above was full of it, as was
the daily press and the mouths of people interested, uninterested,
and disinterested, legitimately or otherwise, until people began to
tire of telling each other exactly how it happened that Gerald
Erroll ran away with Gladys Orchil.</p>
<p>Sanxon Orchil was widely quoted as suavely and urbanely
deploring the premature consummation of an alliance long since
decided upon by both families involved; Mrs. Orchil snapped her
electric-blue eyes and held her peace&mdash;between her very white
teeth; Austin Gerard, secretly astounded with admiration for
Gerald, received the reporters with a countenance expressive of
patient pain, but downtown he made public pretence of busy
indifference, as though not fully alive to the material benefit
connected with the unexpected alliance. Nina wept&mdash;happily at
moments&mdash;at moments she laughed&mdash;because she had heard
all about the famous British invasion planned by the Orchils and
abetted by Anglo-American aristocracy. She did not laugh too
maliciously; she simply couldn't help it. Her set was not the
Orchils' set, their ways were not her ways; their orbits merely
intersected occasionally; and, left to herself and the choice hers,
she would not have troubled herself to engineer any such alliance,
even to stir up Mrs. Sanxon Orchil. Besides, deep in her complacent
little New York soul she had the faintest germ of contempt for the
Cordova ancestors of the house of Orchil.</p>
<p>But the young and silly pair had now relieved her as well as
Mrs. Orchil of any further trouble concerning themselves, the
American duchess, the campaign, and the Horse Guards: they had
married each other rather shamelessly one evening while supposed to
be dancing at the Sandon Craigs', and had departed expensively for
Palm Beach, whither Austin, grim, reticent, but inwardly immensely
contented, despatched the accumulated exclamatory letters of the
family with an intimation of his own that two weeks was long enough
to cut business even with a honeymoon as excuse.</p>
<p>Meanwhile the disorganisation in the nursery was tremendous; the
children, vaguely aware of the household demoralisation and
excitement, took the opportunity to break loose on every occasion;
and Kit-Ki, to her infinite boredom and disgust, was hunted from
garret to cellar; and Drina, taking advantage, contrived to
over-eat herself and sit up late, and was put to bed sick; and
Eileen, loyal, but sorrowfully amazed at her brother's exclusion of
her in such a crisis, became slowly overwhelmed with the
realisation of her loneliness, and took to the seclusion of her own
room, feeling tearful and abandoned, and very much like a very
little girl whose heart was becoming far too full of all sorts of
sorrows.</p>
<p>Nina misunderstood her, finding her lying on her bed, her pale
face pillowed in her hair.</p>
<p>"Only horridly ordinary people will believe that Gerald wanted
her money," said Nina; "as though an Erroll considered such matters
at all&mdash;or needed to. Clear, clean English you are, back to
the cavaliers whose flung purses were their thanks when the
Cordovans held their horses' heads. . . . What are you crying
for?"</p>
<p>"I don't know," said Eileen; "not for anything that you speak
of. Neither Gerald nor I ever wasted any emotion over money, or
what others think about it. . . . Is Drina ill?"</p>
<p>"No; only sick. Calomel will fix her, but she believes she's
close to dissolution and she's sent for Boots to take leave of
him&mdash;the little monkey! I'm so indignant. She's taken
advantage of the general demoralisation to eat up everything in the
house. . . . Billy fell downstairs, fox-hunting, and his nose bled
all over that pink Kirman rug. . . . Boots <i>is</i> a dear; do you
know what he's done?"</p>
<p>"What?" asked Eileen listlessly, raising the back of her slender
hand from her eyes to peer at Nina through the glimmer of
tears.</p>
<p>"Well, he and Phil have moved out of Boots's house, and Boots
has wired Gerald and Gladys that the house is ready for them until
they can find a place of their own. Of course they'll both come
here&mdash;in fact, their luggage is upstairs now&mdash;Boots takes
the blue room and Phil his old quarters, . . . But don't you think
it is perfectly sweet of Boots? And isn't it good to have Philip
back again?"</p>
<p>"Y-es," said Eileen faintly. Lying there, the deep azure of her
eyes starred with tears, a new tremor altered her mouth, and the
tight-curled upper lip quivered. Her heart, too, had begun its
heavy, unsteady response in recognition of her lover's name; she
turned partly away from Nina, burying her face in her brilliant
hair; and beside her slim length, straight and tense, her arms lay,
the small hands contracting till they had closed as tightly as her
teeth.</p>
<p>It was no child, now, who lay there, fighting down the welling
desolation; no visionary adolescent grieving over the colourless
ashes of her first romance; not even the woman, socially achieved,
intelligently and intellectually in love. It was a girl, old enough
to realise that the adoration she had given was not wholly
spiritual, that her delight in her lover and her response to him
was not wholly of the mind, not so purely of the intellect; that
there was still more, something sweeter, more painful, more
bewildering that she could give him, desired to give&mdash;nay,
that she could not withhold even with sealed eyes and arms
outstretched in the darkness of wakeful hours, with her young heart
straining in her breast and her set lips crushing back the
unuttered cry.</p>
<p>Love! So that was it!&mdash;the need, the pain, the
bewilderment, the hot sleeplessness, the mad audacity of a blessed
dream, the flushed awakening, stunned rapture&mdash;and then the
gray truth, bleaching the rose tints from the fading tapestries of
slumberland, leaving her flung across her pillows, staring at
daybreak.</p>
<hr style='width: 45%;' />
<p>Nina had laid a cool smooth hand across her forehead, pushing
back the hair&mdash;a light caress, sensitive as an unasked
question.</p>
<p>But there was no response, and presently the elder woman rose
and went out along the landing, and Eileen heard her laughingly
greeting Boots, who had arrived post-haste on news of Drina's
plight.</p>
<p>"Don't be frightened; the little wretch carried tons of
indigestible stuff to her room and sat up half the night eating it.
Where's Philip?"</p>
<p>"I don't know. Here's a special delivery for him. I signed for
it and brought it from the house. He'll be here from the Hook
directly, I fancy. Where is Drina?"</p>
<p>"In bed. I'll take you up. Mind you, there'll be a scene, so
nerve yourself."</p>
<p>They went upstairs together. Nina knocked, peeped in, then
summoned Mr. Lansing.</p>
<p>"Oh, Boots, Boots!" groaned Drina, lifting her arms and
encircling his neck, "I don't think I am ever going to get
well&mdash;I don't believe it, no matter what they say. I am glad
you have come; I wanted you&mdash;and I'm very, very sick. . . .
Are you happy to be with me?"</p>
<p>Boots sat on the bedside, the feverish little head in his arms,
and Nina was a trifle surprised to see how seriously he took
it.</p>
<p>"Boots," she said, "you look as though your last hour had come.
Are you letting that very bad child frighten you? Drina, dear,
mother doesn't mean to be horrid, but you're too old to whine. . .
. It's time for the medicine, too&mdash;"</p>
<p>"Oh, mother! the nasty kind?"</p>
<p>"Certainly. Boots, if you'll move aside&mdash;"</p>
<p>"Let Boots give it to me!" exclaimed the child tragically. "It
will do no good; I'm not getting better; but if I must take it, let
Boots hold me&mdash;and the spoon!"</p>
<p>She sat straight up in bed with a superb gesture which would
have done credit to that classical gentleman who heroically
swallowed the hemlock cocktail. Some of the dose bespattered Boots,
and when the deed was done the child fell back and buried her head
on his breast, incidentally leaving medicinal traces on his
collar.</p>
<p>Half an hour later she was asleep, holding fast to Boots's
sleeve, and that young gentleman sat in a chair beside her,
discussing with her pretty mother the plans made for Gladys and
Gerald on their expected arrival.</p>
<p>Eileen, pale and heavy-lidded, looked in on her way to some
afternoon affair, nodding unsmiling at Boots.</p>
<p>"Have you been rifling the pantry, too?" he whispered. "You lack
your usual chromatic symphony."</p>
<p>"No, Boots; I'm just tired. If I wasn't physically afraid of
Drina, I'd get you to run off with me&mdash;anywhere. . . . What is
that letter, Nina? For me?"</p>
<p>"It's for Phil. Boots brought it around. Leave it on the library
table, dear, when you go down."</p>
<p>Eileen took the letter and turned away. A few moments later as
she laid it on the library table, her eyes involuntarily noted the
superscription written in the long, angular, fashionable writing of
a woman.</p>
<p>And slowly the inevitable question took shape within her.</p>
<p>How long she stood there she did not know, but the points of her
gloved fingers were still resting on the table and her gaze was
still concentrated on the envelope when she felt Selwyn's presence
in the room, near, close; and looked up into his steady eyes. And
knew he loved her.</p>
<p>And suddenly she broke down&mdash;for with his deep gaze in hers
the overwrought spectre had fled!&mdash;broke down, no longer
doubting, bowing her head in her slim gloved hands, thrilled to the
soul with the certitude of their unhappiness eternal, and the
dreadful pleasure of her share.</p>
<p>"What is it?" he made out to say, managing also to keep his
hands off her where she sat, bowed and quivering by the table.</p>
<p>"N-nothing. A&mdash;a little crisis&mdash;over now&mdash;nearly
over. It was that letter^other women writing you. . . . And
I&mdash;outlawed&mdash;tongue-tied. . . . Don't look at me, don't
wait. I&mdash;I am going out."</p>
<p>He went to the window, stood a moment, came back to the table,
took his letter, and walked slowly again to the window.</p>
<p>After a while he heard the rustle of her gown as she left the
room, and a little later he straightened up, passed his hand across
his tired eyes, and, looking down at the letter in his hand, broke
the seal.</p>
<p>It was from one of the nurses, Miss Casson, and shorter than
usual:</p>
<p>"Mrs. Ruthven is physically in perfect health, but yesterday we
noted a rather startling change in her mental condition. There
were, during the day, intervals that seemed perfectly lucid. Once
she spoke of Miss Bond as 'the other nurse,' as though she realised
something of the conditions surrounding her. Once, too, she seemed
astonished when I brought her a doll, and asked me:' Is there a
child here? Or is it for a charity bazaar?'</p>
<p>"Later I found her writing a letter at my desk. She left it
unfinished when she went to drive&mdash;a mere scrap. I thought it
best to enclose it, which I do, herewith."</p>
<p>The enclosure he opened:</p>
<p>"Phil, dear, though I have been very ill I know you are my own
husband. All the rest was only a child's dream of
terror&mdash;"</p>
<p>And that was all&mdash;only this scrap, firmly written in the
easy flowing hand he knew so well. He studied it for a moment or
two, then resumed Miss Casson's letter:</p>
<p>"A man stopped our sleigh yesterday, asking if he was not
speaking to Mrs. Ruthven. I was a trifle worried, and replied that
any communication for Mrs. Ruthven could be sent to me.</p>
<p>"That evening two men&mdash;gentlemen apparently&mdash;came to
the house and asked for me. I went down to receive them. One was a
Dr. Mallison, the other said his name was Thomas B. Hallam, but
gave no business address.</p>
<p>"When I found that they had come without your knowledge and
authority, I refused to discuss Mrs. Ruthven's condition, and the
one who said his name was Hallam spoke rather peremptorily and in a
way that made me think he might be a lawyer.</p>
<p>"They got nothing out of me, and they left when I made it plain
that I had nothing to tell them.</p>
<p>"I thought it best to let you know about this, though I,
personally, cannot guess what it might mean."</p>
<p>Selwyn turned the page:</p>
<p>"One other matter worries Miss Bond and myself. The revolver you
sent us at my request has disappeared. We are nearly sure Mrs.
Ruthven has it&mdash;you know she once dressed it as a
doll&mdash;calling it her army doll!&mdash;but now we can't find
it. She has hidden it somewhere, out of doors in the shrubbery, we
think, and Miss Bond and I expect to secure it the next time she
takes a fancy to have all her dolls out for a 'lawn-party.'</p>
<p>"Dr. Wesson says there is no danger of her doing any harm with
it, but wants us to secure it at the first opportunity&mdash;"</p>
<p>He turned the last page; on the other side was merely the
formula of leave-taking and Miss Casson's signature.</p>
<p>For a while he stood in the centre of the room, head bent,
narrowing eyes fixed; then he folded the letter, pocketed it, and
walked to the table where a directory lay.</p>
<p>He found the name, Hallam, very easily&mdash;Thomas B. Hallam,
lawyer, junior in the firm of Spencer, Boyd &amp; Hallam. They were
attorneys for Jack Ruthven; he knew that.</p>
<p>Mallison he also found&mdash;Dr. James Mallison, who, it
appeared, conducted some sort of private asylum on Long Island.</p>
<p>And when he had found what he wanted, he went to the telephone
and rang up Mr. Ruthven, but the servant who answered the telephone
informed him that Mr. Ruthven was not in town.</p>
<p>So Selwyn hung up the receiver and sat down, thoughtful, grim,
the trace of a scowl creeping across his narrowing gray eyes.</p>
<p>Of the abject cowardice of Ruthven he had been so certain that
he had hitherto discounted any interference from him. Yet, now, the
man was apparently preparing for some sort of interference. What
did he want? Selwyn had contemptuously refused to permit him to
seek a divorce on the ground of his wife's infirmity. What was the
man after?</p>
<hr style='width: 45%;' />
<p>The man was after his divorce, that was what it all meant. His
first check on the long trail came with the stupefying news of
Gerald's runaway marriage to the young girl he was laying his own
plans to marry some day in the future, and at first the news
staggered him, leaving him apparently no immediate incentive for
securing his freedom.</p>
<p>But Ruthven instantly began to realise that what he had lost he
might not have lost had he been free to shoulder aside the young
fellow who had forestalled him. The chance had passed&mdash;that
particular chance. But he'd never again allow himself to be caught
in a position where such a chance could pass him by because he was
not legally free to at least make the effort to seize it.</p>
<p>Fear in his soul had kept him from blazoning his wife's
infirmity to the world as cause for an action against her; but he
remembered Neergard's impudent cruise with her on the
<i>Niobrara</i>, and he had temporarily settled on that as a means
to extort revenue, not intending such an action should ever come to
trial. And then he learned that Neergard had gone to pieces. That
was the second check.</p>
<p>Ruthven needed money. He needed it because he meant to put the
ocean between himself and Selwyn before commencing any
suit&mdash;whatever ground he might choose for entering such a
suit. He required capital on which to live abroad during the
proceedings, if that could be legally arranged. And meanwhile,
preliminary to any plan of campaign, he desired to know where his
wife was and what might he her actual physical and mental
condition.</p>
<p>He had supposed her to be, or to have been, ill&mdash;at least
erratic and not to be trusted with her own freedom; therefore he
had been quite prepared to hear from those whom he employed to
trace and find her that she was housed in some institution devoted
to the incarceration of such unfortunates.</p>
<p>But Ruthven was totally unprepared for the report brought him by
a private agency to the effect that Mrs. Ruthven was apparently in
perfect health, living in the country, maintaining a villa and
staff of servants; that she might be seen driving a perfectly
appointed Cossack sleigh any day with a groom on the rumble and a
companion beside her; that she seemed to be perfectly sane, healthy
in body and mind, comfortable, happy, and enjoying life under the
protection of a certain Captain Selwyn, who paid all her bills and,
at certain times, was seen entering or leaving her house at
Edgewater.</p>
<p>Excited, incredulous, but hoping for the worst, Ruthven had
posted off to his attorneys. To them he na&iuml;ively confessed his
desire to be rid of Alixe; he reported her misconduct with
Neergard&mdash;which he knew was a lie&mdash;her pretence of mental
prostration, her disappearance, and his last interview with Selwyn
in the card-room. He also gave a vivid description of that
gentleman's disgusting behaviour, and his threats of violence
during that interview.</p>
<p>To all of which his attorneys listened very attentively, bade
him have no fear of his life, requested him to make several
affidavits, and leave the rest to them for the present.</p>
<p>Which he did, without hearing from them until Mr. Hallam
telegraphed him to come to Edgewater if he had nothing better to
do.</p>
<p>And Ruthven had just arrived at that inconspicuous Long Island
village when his servant, at the telephone, replied to Selwyn's
inquiry that his master was out of town.</p>
<hr style='width: 45%;' />
<p>Mr. Hallam was a very busy, very sanguine, very impetuous young
man; and when he met Ruthven at the Edgewater station he told him
promptly that he had the best case on earth; that he, Hallam, was
going to New York on the next train, now almost due, and that
Ruthven had better drive over and see for himself how gaily his
wife maintained her household; for the Cossack sleigh, with its gay
crimson tchug, had but just returned from the usual afternoon spin,
and the young chatelaine of Willow Villa was now on the
snow-covered lawn, romping with the coachman's huge white
wolf-hound. . . . It might he just as well for Ruthven to stroll up
that way and see for himself. The house was known as the Willow
Villa. Any hackman could drive him past it.</p>
<p>As Hallam was speaking the New York train came thundering in,
and the young lawyer, facing the snowy clouds of steam, swung his
suit-case and himself aboard. On the Pullman platform he paused and
looked around and down at Ruthven.</p>
<p>"It's just as you like," he said. "If you'd rather come back
with me on this train, come ahead! It isn't absolutely necessary
that you make a personal inspection now; only that fellow Selwyn is
not here to-day, and I thought if you wanted to look about a bit
you could do it this afternoon without chance of running into him
and startling the whole mess boiling."</p>
<p>"Is Captain Selwyn in town?" asked Ruthven, reddening.</p>
<p>"Yes; an agency man telephoned me that he's just back from Sandy
Hook&mdash;"</p>
<p>The train began to move out of the station. Ruthven hesitated,
then stepped away from the passing car with a significant parting
nod to Hallam.</p>
<p>As the train, gathering momentum, swept past him, he stared
about at the snow-covered station, the guard, the few people
congregated there.</p>
<p>"There's another train at four, isn't there?" he asked an
official.</p>
<p>"Four-thirty, express. Yes, sir."</p>
<p>A hackman came up soliciting patronage. Ruthven motioned him to
follow, leading the way to the edge of the platform.</p>
<p>"I don't want to drive to the village. What have you got there,
a sleigh?"</p>
<p>It was the usual Long Island depot-wagon, on runners instead of
wheels.</p>
<p>"Do you know the Willow Villa?" demanded Ruthven.</p>
<p>"Wilier Viller, sir? Yes, sir. Step right this way&mdash;"</p>
<p>"Wait!" snapped Ruthven. "I asked you if you knew it; I didn't
say I wanted to go there."</p>
<p>The hackman in his woolly greatcoat stared at the little dapper,
smooth-shaven man, who eyed him in return, coolly insolent,
lighting a cigar.</p>
<p>"I don't want to go to the Willow Villa," said Ruthven; "I want
you to drive me past it."</p>
<p>"Sir?"</p>
<p>"<i>Past</i> it. And then turn around and drive back here. Is
that plain?"</p>
<p>"Yes, sir."</p>
<p>Ruthven got into the closed body of the vehicle, rubbed the
frost from the window, and peeked out. The hackman, unhitching his
lank horse, climbed to the seat, gathered the reins, and the
vehicle started to the jangling accompaniment of a single battered
cow-bell.</p>
<p>The melancholy clamour of the bell annoyed little Mr. Ruthven;
he was horribly cold, too, even in his fur coat. Also the musty
smell of the ancient vehicle annoyed him as he sat, half turned
around, peeping out of the rear window into the white tree-lined
road.</p>
<p>There was nothing to see but the snowy road flanked by trees and
stark hedges; nothing but the flat expanse of white on either side,
broken here and there by patches of thin woodlands or by some
old-time farmhouse with its slab shingles painted white and its
green shutters and squat roof.</p>
<p>"What a God-forsaken place," muttered little Mr. Ruthven with a
hard grimace. "If she's happy in this sort of a hole there's no
doubt she's some sort of a lunatic."</p>
<p>He looked out again furtively, thinking of what the agency had
reported to him. How was it possible for any human creature to live
in such a waste and be happy and healthy and gay, as they told him
his wife was. What could a human being do to kill the horror of
such silent, deathly white isolation? Drive about in it in a
Cossack sleigh, as they said she did? Horror!</p>
<p>The driver pulled up short, then began to turn his horse.
Ruthven squinted out of the window, but saw no sign of a villa.
Then he rapped sharply on the forward window, motioning the driver
to descend, come around, and open the door.</p>
<p>When the man appeared Ruthven demanded why he had turned his
horse, and the hackman, pointing to a wooded hill to the west,
explained that the Willow Villa stood there.</p>
<p>Ruthven had supposed that the main road passed the house; he got
out of the covered wagon, looked across at the low hill, and dug
his gloved hands deeper into his fur-lined pockets.</p>
<p>For a while he stood in the snow, stolid, thoughtful, puffing
his cigar. A half-contemptuous curiosity possessed him to see his
wife once more before he discarded her; see what she looked like,
whether she appeared normal and in possession of the small amount
of sense he had condescended to credit her with.</p>
<p>Besides, here was a safe chance to see her. Selwyn was in New
York, and the absolute certainty of his personal safety attracted
him strongly, rousing all the latent tyranny in his meagre
soul.</p>
<p>Probably&mdash;but he didn't understand the legal requirements
of the matter, and whether or not it was necessary for him
personally to see this place where Selwyn maintained her, and see
her in it&mdash;probably he would be obliged to come here again
with far less certainty of personal security from Selwyn. Perhaps
that future visit might even be avoided if he took this opportunity
to investigate. Whether it was the half-sneering curiosity to see
his wife, or the hope of doing a thing now which, by the doing, he
need not do later&mdash;whether it was either of these that moved
him to the impulse, is not quite clear.</p>
<p>He said to the hackman: "You wait here. I'm going over to the
Willow Villa for a few moments, and then I'll want you to drive me
back to the station in time for that four-thirty. Do you
understand?"</p>
<p>The man said he understood, and Ruthven, bundled in his fur
coat, picked his way across the crust, through a gateway, and up
what appeared to be a hedged lane.</p>
<p>The lane presently disclosed itself as an avenue, now doubly
lined with tall trees; this avenue he continued to follow, passing
through a grove of locusts, and came out before a house on the low
crest of a hill.</p>
<p>There were clumps of evergreens about, tall cedars, a bit of
bushy foreland, and a stretch of snow. And across this open space
of snow a young girl was moving, followed by a white wolf-hound.
Once she paused, hesitated, looked cautiously around her. Ruthven,
hiding behind a bush, saw her thrust her arm into a low evergreen
shrub and draw out a shining object that glittered like glass. Then
she started toward the house again.</p>
<p>At first Ruthven thought she was his wife, then he was not sure,
and he cast his cigar away and followed, slinking forward among the
evergreens. But the youthful fur-clad figure kept straight on to
the veranda of the house, and Ruthven, curious and determined to
find out whether it was Alixe or not, left the semi-shelter of the
evergreens and crossed the open space just as the woman's figure
disappeared around an angle of the veranda.</p>
<p>Vexed, determined not to return without some definite discovery,
Ruthven stepped upon the veranda. Just around the angle of the
porch he heard a door opening, and he hurried forward impatient and
absolutely unafraid, anxious to get one good look at his wife and
be off.</p>
<p>But when he turned the angle of the porch there was no one
there; only an open door confronted him, with a big, mild-eyed
wolf-hound standing in the doorway, looking steadily up at him.</p>
<p>Ruthven glanced somewhat dubiously at the dog, then, as the
animal made no offensive movement, he craned his fleshy neck,
striving to see inside the house.</p>
<p>He did see&mdash;nothing very much&mdash;only the same young
girl, still in her furs, emerging from an inner room, her arms full
of dolls.</p>
<p>In his eagerness to see more, Ruthven pushed past the great
white dog, who withdrew his head disdainfully from the
unceremonious contact, but quietly followed Ruthven into the house,
standing beside him, watching him out of great limpid, deerlike
eyes.</p>
<p>But Ruthven no longer heeded the dog. His amused and slightly
sneering gaze was fastened on the girl in furs who had entered what
appeared to be a living room to the right, and now, down on her
knees beside a couch, smiling and talking confidentially and quite
happily to herself, was placing her dolls in a row against the
wall.</p>
<p>The dolls were of various sorts, some plainly enough home-made,
some very waxy and gay in sash and lace, some with polished smiling
features of porcelain. One doll, however, was different&mdash;a bit
of ragged red flannel and something protruding to represent the
head, something that glittered. And the girl in the fur jacket had
this curious doll in her hands when Ruthven, to make sure of her
identity, took a quick impulsive step forward.</p>
<div class="figcenter"><a href=
"images/facing_page500.jpg"><img src="images/facing_page500.jpg"
width="45%" alt="" title="" /></a><br />
<b>"With the acrid smell of smoke choking her."</b>
<br /></div>
<p>Then the great white dog growled, very low, and the girl in the
fur jacket looked around and up quickly.</p>
<p>Alixe! He realised it as she caught his pale eyes fixed on her;
and she stared, sprang to her feet still staring. Then into her
eyes leaped terror, the living horror of recognition distorting her
face. And, as she saw he meant to speak she recoiled, shrinking
away, turning in her fright like a hunted thing. The strange doll
in her hand glittered; it was a revolver wrapped in a red rag.</p>
<p>"W-what's the matter?" he stammered, stepping forward, fearful
of the weapon she clutched.</p>
<p>But at the sound of his voice she screamed, crept back closer
against the wall, screamed again, pushing the shining muzzle of the
weapon deep into her fur jacket above her breast.</p>
<p>"F-for God's sake!" he gasped, "don't
fire!&mdash;don't&mdash;"</p>
<p>She closed both eyes and pulled the trigger; something knocked
her flat against the wall, but she heard no sound of a report, and
she pulled the trigger again and felt another blow.</p>
<p>The second blow must have knocked her down, for she found
herself rising to her knees, reaching for the table to aid her. But
her hand was all red and slippery; she looked at it stupidly, fell
forward, rose again, with the acrid smell of smoke choking her, and
her pretty fur jacket all soaked with the warm wet stuff which now
stained both hands.</p>
<p>Then she got to her knees once more, groped in the rushing
darkness, and swayed forward, falling loosely and flat. And this
time she did not try to rise.</p>
<hr style='width: 45%;' />
<p>It was her way; it had always been her way out of trouble; the
quickest, easiest escape from what she did not choose to endure.
And even when in her mind the light of reason had gone out for
ever, she had not lost that instinct for escape; and, wittingly or
not, she had taken the old way out of trouble&mdash;the shortest,
quickest way. And where it leads&mdash;she knew at last, lying
there on her face, her fur jacket and her little hands so soiled
and red.</p>
<p>As for the man, they finally contrived to drag the dog from him,
and lift him to the couch, where he lay twitching among the dolls
for a while; then stopped twitching.</p>
<p>Later in the night men came with lanterns who carried him away.
A doctor said that there was the usual chance for partial recovery.
But it was the last excitement he could ever venture to indulge in.
His own doctors had warned him often enough. Now he had learned
something, but not as much as Alixe had already learned. And
perhaps he never would; but no man knows such things with the
authority to speak of them.</p>
<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h2><a name="ARS_AMORIS" id="ARS_AMORIS"></a>ARS AMORIS</h2>
<p>Nine days is the period of time allotted the human mind in which
to wonder at anything. In New York the limit is much less; no
tragedy can hold the boards as long as that where the bill must be
renewed three times u day to hold even the passing attention of
those who themselves are eternal understudies in the continuous
metropolitan performance. It is very expensive for the newspapers,
but fortunately for them there is always plenty of trouble in the
five boroughs, and an occasional catastrophe elsewhere to help
out.</p>
<p>So they were grateful enough that the Edgewater tragedy lasted
them forty-eight hours, and on the forty-ninth they forgot it.</p>
<p>In society it was about the same. Ruthven was evidently done
for; that the spark of mere vitality might linger for years in the
exterior shell of him familiar to his world, concerned that world
no more. Interest in him was laid aside with the perfunctory
finality with which the memory of Alixe was laid away.</p>
<p>As for Selwyn, a few people noticed his presence at the
services; but even that episode was forgotten before he left the
city, six hours later, under an invitation from Washington which
admitted of no delay on the score of private business or of
personal perplexity. For the summons was peremptory, and his
obedience so immediate that a telegram to Austin comprised and
concluded the entire ceremony of his leave-taking.</p>
<p>Later he wrote a great many letters to Eileen Erroll&mdash;not
one of which he ever sent. But the formality of his silence was no
mystery to her; and her response was silence as profound as the
stillness in her soul. But deep into her young heart something new
had been born, faint fire, latent, unstirred; and her delicate lips
rested one on the other in the sensitive curve of suspense; and her
white fingers, often now interlinked, seemed tremulously instinct
with the exquisite tension hushing body and soul in breathless
accord as they waited in unison.</p>
<hr style='width: 45%;' />
<p>Toward the end of March the special service battleship squadron
of the North Atlantic fleet commenced testing Chaosite in the
vicinity of the Southern rendezvous. Both main and secondary
batteries were employed. Selwyn had been aboard the flag-ship for
nearly a month.</p>
<p>In April the armoured ships left the Southern drill ground and
began to move northward. A destroyer took Selwyn across to the
great fortress inside the Virginia Capes and left him there. During
his stay there was almost constant firing; later he continued
northward as far as Washington; but it was not until June that he
telegraphed Austin:</p>
<div class="blockquot">
<p>"Government satisfied. Appropriation certain next session. Am on
my way to New York."</p>
</div>
<p>Austin, in his house, which was now dismantled for the summer,
telephoned Nina at Silverside that he had been detained and might
not be able to grace the festivities which were to consist of a
neighbourhood dinner to the younger set in honour of Mrs. Gerald.
But he said nothing about Selwyn, and Nina did not suspect that her
brother's arrival in New York had anything to do with Austin's
detention.</p>
<p>There was in Austin a curious substreak of sentiment which
seldom came to the surface except where his immediate family was
involved. In his dealings with others he avoided it; even with
Gerald and Eileen there had been little of this sentiment apparent.
But where Selwyn was concerned, from the very first days of their
friendship, he had always felt in his heart very close to the man
whose sister he had married, and was always almost automatically on
his guard to avoid any expression of that affection. Once he had
done so, or attempted to, when Selwyn first arrived from the
Philippines, and it made them both uncomfortable to the verge of
profanity, but remained as a shy source of solace to them both.</p>
<p>And now as Selwyn came leisurely up the front steps, Austin,
awaiting him feverishly, hastened to smooth the florid jocose mask
over his features, and walked into the room, big hand extended,
large bantering voice undisturbed by the tremor of a welcome which
filled his heart and came near filling his eyes:</p>
<p>"So you've stuck the poor old Government at last, have you? Took
'em all in&mdash;forts, fleet, and the marine cavalry?"</p>
<p>"Sure thing," said Selwyn, laughing in the crushing grasp of the
big fist. "How are you, Austin? Everybody's in the country, I
suppose," glancing around at the linen-shrouded furniture. "How is
Nina? And the kids? . . . Good business! . . . And Eileen?"</p>
<p>"She's all right," said Austin; "gad! she's really a superb
specimen this summer. . . . You know she rather eased off last
winter&mdash;got white around the gills and blue under the eyes. .
. . Some heart trouble&mdash;we all thought it was you. Young girls
have such notions sometimes, and I told Nina, but she sat on me. .
. . Where's your luggage? Oh, is it all here?&mdash;enough, I mean,
for us to catch a train for Silverside this afternoon."</p>
<p>"Has Nina any room for me?" asked Selwyn.</p>
<p>"Room! Certainly. I didn't tell her you were coming, because if
you hadn't, the kids would have been horribly disappointed. She and
Eileen are giving a shindy for Gladys&mdash;that's Gerald's new
acquisition, you know. So if you don't mind butting into a
baby-show we'll run down. It's only the younger bunch from
Hitherwood House and Brookminster. What do you say, Phil?"</p>
<p>Selwyn said that he would go&mdash;hesitating before consenting.
A curious feeling of age and grayness had suddenly come over
him&mdash;a hint of fatigue, of consciousness that much of life lay
behind him.</p>
<p>Yet in his face and in his bearing he could not have shown much
of it, though at his deeply sun-burned temples the thick, close-cut
hair was silvery; for Austin said with amused and at the same time
fretful emphasis: "How the devil you keep the youth" in your face
and figure I don't understand! I'm only forty-five&mdash;that's
scarcely eight years older than you are! And look at my waistcoat!
And look at my hair&mdash;I mean where the confounded ebb has left
the tide-mark! Gad, I'd scarcely blame Eileen for thinking you
qualified for a cradle-snatcher. . . . And, by the way, that Gladys
girl is more of a woman than you'd believe. I observe that Gerald
wears that peculiarly speak-easy-please expression which is a
healthy sign that he's being managed right from the beginning."</p>
<p>"I had an idea she was all right," said Selwyn, smiling.</p>
<p>"Well, she is. People will probably say that she 'made' Gerald.
However," added Austin modestly, "I shall never deny
it&mdash;though you know what part I've had in the making and
breaking of him, don't you?"</p>
<p>"Yes," replied Selwyn, without a smile.</p>
<p>Austin went to the telephone and called up his house at
Silverside, saying that he'd be down that evening with a guest.</p>
<p>Nina got the message just as she had arranged her tables; but
woman is born to sorrow and heiress to all the unlooked-for
idiocies of man.</p>
<p>"Dear," she said to Eileen, the tears of uxorial vexation drying
unshed in her pretty eyes, "Austin has thought fit to seize upon
this moment to bring a man down to dinner. So if you are dressed
would you kindly see that the tables are rearranged, and then
telephone somebody to fill in&mdash;two girls, you know. The oldest
Craig girl might do for one. Beg her mother to let her come."</p>
<p>Eileen was being laced, but she walked to the door of Nina's
room, followed by her little Alsatian maid, who deftly continued
her offices <i>en route</i>.</p>
<p>"Whom is Austin bringing?" she asked.</p>
<p>"He didn't say. Can't you think of a second girl to get? Isn't
it vexing! Of course there's nobody left&mdash;nobody ever fills in
in the country. . . . Do you know, I'll be driven into letting
Drina sit up with us!&mdash;for sheer lack of material. I suppose
the little imp will have a fit if I suggest it, and probably perish
of indigestion to-morrow."</p>
<p>Eileen laughed. "Oh, Nina, <i>do</i> let Drina come this once!
It can't hurt her&mdash;she'll look so quaint. The child's nearly
fifteen, you know; do let me put up her hair. Boots will take her
in."</p>
<p>"Well, you and Austin can administer the calomel to-morrow,
then. . . . And do ring up Daisy Craig; tell her mother I'm
desperate, and that she and Drina can occupy the same hospital
to-morrow."</p>
<p>And so it happened that among the jolly youthful throng which
clustered around the little candle-lighted tables in the
dining-room at Silverside, Drina, in ecstasy, curly hair just above
the nape of her slim white neck, and cheeks like pink fire, sat
between Boots and a vacant chair reserved for her tardy father.</p>
<p>For Nina had waited as long as she dared; then Boots had been
summoned to take in Drina and the youthful Craig girl; and, as
there were to have been six at a table, at that particular table
sat Boots decorously facing Eileen, with the two children on either
hand and two empty chairs flanking Eileen.</p>
<p>A jolly informality made up for Austin's shortcoming; Gerald and
his pretty bride were the centres of delighted curiosity from the
Minster twins and the Innis girls and Evelyn Cardwell&mdash;all her
intimates. And the younger Draymores, the Grays, Lawns, and Craigs
were there in force&mdash;gay, noisy, unembarrassed young people
who seemed scarcely younger or gayer than the young matron, their
hostess.</p>
<p>As for Gladys, it was difficult to think of her as married; and
to Boots Drina whispered blissfully: "I look almost as old; I know
I do. After this I shall certainly make no end of a fuss if they
don't let me dine with them. Besides, you want me to, don't you,
Boots?"</p>
<p>"Of course I do."</p>
<p>"And&mdash;am I quite as entertaining to you as older girls,
Boots, dear?"</p>
<p>"Far more entertaining," said that young man promptly. "In fact,
I've about decided to cut out all the dinners where you're not
invited. It's only three more years, anyway, before you're asked
about, and if I omit three years of indigestible dinners I'll be in
better shape to endure the deluge after you appear and make your
bow."</p>
<p>"When I make my bow," murmured the child; "oh, Boots, I am in
such a hurry to make it! It doesn't seem as if I <i>could</i> wait
three more long, awful, disgusting years! . . . How does my hair
look?"</p>
<p>"Adorable," he said, smiling across at Eileen, who had heard the
question.</p>
<p>"Do you think my arms are very thin? Do you?" insisted
Drina.</p>
<p>"Dreams of Grecian perfection," explained Boots. And, lowering
his voice, "You ought not to eat <i>everything</i> they bring you;
there'll be doings to-morrow if you do. Eileen is shaking her
head."</p>
<p>"I don't care; people don't die of overeating. And I'll take
their nasty old medicine&mdash;truly I will, Boots, if you'll come
and give it to me."</p>
<p>The younger Craig maiden also appeared to be bent upon
self-destruction; and Boots's eyes opened wider and wider in sheer
amazement at the capacity of woman in embryo for rations sufficient
to maintain a small garrison.</p>
<p>"There'll be a couple of reports," he said to himself with a
shudder, "like Selwyn's Chaosite. And then there'll be no more
Drina and Daisy&mdash;Hello!"&mdash;he broke off,
astonished&mdash;"Well, upon my word of words! Phil
Selwyn!&mdash;or I'm a broker!"</p>
<p>"Phil!" exclaimed Nina.. "Oh, Austin!&mdash;and you never told
us&mdash;"</p>
<p>Austin, ruddy and bland, came up to make his excuses; a little
whirlwind of excitement passed like a brisk breeze over the
clustered tables as Selwyn followed; and a dozen impulsive bare
arms were outstretched to greet him as he passed, returning the
bright, eager salutations on every hand.</p>
<p>"Train was late as usual," observed Austin. "Philip and I don't
mean to butt into this very grand function&mdash;Hello, Gerald!
Hello, Gladys! . . . Where's our obscure corner below the salt,
Nina? . . . Oh, over there&mdash;"</p>
<p>Selwyn had already caught sight of the table destined for him. A
deeper colour crept across his bronzed face as he stepped forward,
and his firm hand closed over the slim hand offered.</p>
<p>For a moment neither spoke; she could not; he dared not.</p>
<p>Then Drina caught his hands, and Eileen's loosened in his clasp
and fell away as the child said distinctly, "I'll kiss you after
dinner; it can't be done here, can it, Eileen?"</p>
<p>"You little monkey!" exclaimed her father, astonished; "what in
the name of cruelty to kids are <i>you</i> doing here?"</p>
<p>"Mother let me," observed the child, reaching for a bonbon.
"Daisy is here; you didn't speak to her."</p>
<p>"I'm past conversation," said Austin grimly, "and Daisy appears
to be also. Are they to send an ambulance for you, Miss
Craig?&mdash;or will you occupy the emergency ward upstairs?"</p>
<p>"Upstairs," said Miss Craig briefly. It was all she could utter.
Besides, she was occupied with a pink cream-puff. Austin and Boots
watched her with a dreadful fascination; but she seemed competent
to manage it.</p>
<p>Selwyn, beside Eileen, had ventured on the formalities&mdash;his
voice unsteady and not yet his own.</p>
<p>Her loveliness had been a memory; he had supposed he realised it
to himself; but the superb, fresh beauty of the girl dazed him.
There was a strange new radiancy, a living brightness to her that
seemed almost unreal. Exquisitely unreal her voice, too, and the
slightly bent head, crowned with the splendour of her hair; and the
slowly raised eyes, two deep blue miracles tinged with the hues of
paradise.</p>
<p>"There's no use," sighed Drina, "I shall not be able to dance.
Boots, there's to be a dance, you know; so I'll sit on the stairs
with Daisy Craig; and you'll come to me occasionally, won't
you?"</p>
<p>Miss Craig yawned frightfully and made a purely mechanical move
toward an iced strawberry. Before she got it Nina gave the rising
signal.</p>
<p>"Are you remaining to smoke?" asked Eileen as Selwyn took her to
the doorway. "Because, if you are not&mdash;I'll wait for you."</p>
<p>"Where?" he asked.</p>
<p>"Anywhere. . . . Where shall I?"</p>
<p>Again the twin blue miracles were lifted to his; and deep in
them he saw her young soul, waiting.</p>
<p>Around them was the gay confusion, adieux, and laughter of
partners parted for the moment; Nina passed them with a smiling
nod; Boots conducted Drina to a resting-place on the stairs;
outside, the hall was thronged with the younger set, and already
their partners were returning to the tables.</p>
<p>"Find me when you can get away," said Eileen, looking once more
at Selwyn; "Nina is signalling me now."</p>
<p>Again, as of old, her outstretched hand&mdash;the little
formality symbolising to him the importance of all that concerned
them. He touched it.</p>
<p>"<i>A bient&ocirc;t</i>," she said.</p>
<p>"On the lawn out there&mdash;farther out, in the starlight," he
whispered&mdash;his voice broke&mdash;"my darling&mdash;"</p>
<p>She bent her head, passing slowly before him, turned, looked
back, her answer in her eyes, her lips, in every limb, every line
and contour of her, as she stood a moment, looking back.</p>
<p>Austin and Boots were talking volubly when he returned to the
tables now veiled in a fine haze of aromatic smoke. Gerald stuck
close to him, happy, excited, shy by turns. Others came up on every
side&mdash;young, frank, confident fellows, nice in bearing, of
good speech and manner.</p>
<p>And outside waited their pretty partners of the younger set,
gossiping in hall, on stairs and veranda in garrulous bevies, all
filmy silks and laces and bright-eyed expectancy.</p>
<p>The long windows were open to the veranda; Selwyn, with his arm
through Gerald's, walked to the railing and looked out across the
fragrant starlit waste. And very far away they heard the sea
intoning the hymn of the four winds.</p>
<p>Then the elder man withdrew his arm and stood apart for a while.
A little later he descended to the lawn, crossed it, and walked
straight out into the waste.</p>
<p>The song of the sea was rising now. In the strange little forest
below, deep among the trees, elfin lights broke out across the
unseen Brier water, then vanished.</p>
<div><a name="Page513" id="Page513"></a></div>
<p>He halted to listen; he looked long and steadily into the
darkness around him. Suddenly he saw her&mdash;a pale blur in the
dusk.</p>
<p>"Eileen?"</p>
<p>"Is it you, Philip?"</p>
<p>She stood waiting as he came up through the purple gloom of the
moorland, the stars' brilliancy silvering
her&mdash;waiting&mdash;yielding in pallid silence to his arms,
crushed in them, looking into his eyes, dumb, wordless.</p>
<p>Then slowly the pale sacrament changed as the wild-rose tint
crept into her face; her arms clung to his shoulders, higher,
tightened around his neck. And from her lips she gave into his
keeping soul and body, guiltless as God gave it, to have and to
hold beyond such incidents as death and the eternity that no man
clings to save in the arms of such as she.</p>

<p><b>THE LEADING NOVEL OF TODAY.</b></p>
<p>The Fighting Chance.</p>
<p>By ROBERT W. CHAMBERS. Illustrated by A.B. Wenzell. 12mo.
Ornamental Cloth, $1.50.</p>
<p>In "The Fighting Chance" Mr. Chambers has taken for his hero, a
young fellow who has inherited with his wealth a craving for
liquor. The heroine has inherited a certain rebelliousness and
dangerous caprice. The two, meeting on the brink of ruin, fight out
their battles, two weaknesses joined with love to make a strength.
It is refreshing to find a story about the rich in which all the
women are not sawdust at heart, nor all the men satyrs. The rich
have their longings, their ideals, their regrets, as well as the
poor; they have their struggles and inherited evils to combat. It
is a big subject, painted with a big brush and a big heart.</p>

Chance' is very good and it does not suffer."&mdash;<i>Cleveland

forget easily and it will for many throw new light on a phase of
revolutionary history replete with interest and

<p>"Chambers' bullets whistle almost audibly in the pages; when a
twig snaps, as twigs do perforce in these chronicles, you can
almost feel the presence of the savage buck who snaps it. Then
there are situations of force and effect everywhere through the
pages, an intensity of action, a certain naturalness of dialogue
and 'human nature' in the incidents. But over all is the glamor of
the Chambers fancy, the gauzy woof of an artist's imagination which
glories in tints, in poesies, in the little whims of the brush and
pencil, so that you have just a pleasant reminder of unreality and
a glimpse of the author himself here and there to vary the
interest."&mdash;<i>St. Louis Republic</i>.</p>

collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
